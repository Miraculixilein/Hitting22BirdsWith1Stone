Hey Bas.
 Fleur
Alles goed.
 Bas
Yeah, prima met jullie ook or should I switch to English or zijn jullie gewoon Nederlands allebei?
 Lukas
Ik kan een beetje Nederlands
 Fleur
Nee it’s in English.
 Lukas
But the interview.
 Bas
OK.
 Lukas
It would be nice if the interviews. Is in English, because then if you type.
 Bas
Yeah yeah no, no problem.
 Lukas
Nice.
 Fleur
Yeah, so thanks for taking the time of your busy schedule. Thank you.
 Fleur
I know you're really busy, so thanks.
 Bas
No problem.
 Fleur
Real friend here.
 Fleur
So as I said, we're doing a research methods course.
 Fleur
So we have to like write a whole  research and conduct interviews, and in this case we are writing a paper about the sharing economy and in this case the non-adoption of the sharing economy. 
 Bas
Yeah.
 Fleur
And in this case it's Swapfiets
 Fleur
So you are not an adaptor of swapfiets, right?
 
Bas
No.
 Fleur
So we would like to know why, and that's why we're doing this interview, so.
 Bas
OK, yeah sure.
 Fleur
Let's start, so first a little background from you.
 Fleur
Can you tell me your name how old you are and what your general occupation is.
 Bas
So occupation, OK. Well, I’m Bas. I'm 27 years old, although I'm almost turning 28, but Ilive in Utrecht this is specified for Utrecht this  research, right? Yes, yeah. Well yeah, I am now almost done with my master studies in Wageningen but currently doing that here in Utrecht, and currently finishing my  internship.
Bas
Yeah, well, that's basically it for now I think.
 Bas
Yeah.
 Lukas
That's it.
 Fleur
OK yeah, so could you tell me a bit about your biking habits and your view on swap fiets?
 Fleur
Oh
 Bas
Yeah, well, actually it's really, It's a funny story about Swapfiets in Wageningen  and I don't know if you know the trend there, like what students there do with Swapbikes is overnight they swap the bikes You see it overnight they swap the bikes up with all this and then turning around.. uh op de kop

 Fleur
Oh really?
 Bas
Yeah, because it is called swap fiets so students make fun of it and take out all the bikes and actually they're really not happy about the students in Wageningen because they really damaged those bikes with that. And actually the police are really taking it seriously and if they find you doing that, you'll really get a big fine.
 Lukas
Does it, does it really like this? Like does it really get broken or like, damaged
 Bas
If you do it very, very gently, not but hese students are mostly doing it in a drunk state alone is almost like throwing it upside down there.
Bas
But other than that, my view towards swap fiets, which is pretty good and some friends also using it, but I'm curious what is currently the price for a swapfiets, do you know?
 Fleur
It ranges from like 12 to 70
Bas
Yes, OK, all right
Fleur
 'cause the 70 one  Is like an electric bike and super fancy, yeah?
 Lukas
Yeah, something for students, yeah?
 Bas
Oh OK, yeah.
 Bas
OK yeah OK well so for me. 
Bas
Oh I when I bike through the city I used very cheap but then I thought I got a second hand market. Probably stolen, these were like 30 or 40 year euro. So and mostly I can go on again for like at least two years so for me it’s cost less to actually have such a bike, then choose for swap fiets, although they really it's really nice to include the repair and maintaining and I have to say I admit that with my bike… Yeah.. Sometimes I don't know. Maybe swap fiets would be eventually cheaper than I think for me not using swapfiets is cheaper than having the other bikes, but that's the main reason why I didn't choose swapfiets but other than that, but I really like the opportunity and well this whole idea they put.
 Lukas
Yeah, well, you're touching a lot about this stuff that already that we were that we're going to specify later on.
Lukas
But maybe It might be interesting to ask now. 
Lukas
And So what if your if your current bike broke down now would that mean now that you would then you say that if it's cheaper that the variation that you just have?
 Lukas
And we can go down for a swapfiets all together
 Bas
Really.
 Bas
I actually, my next bike if my current bank broke. I would really consider taking swapfiets.
Bas
But because I have to admit that my bike often gets broken because I have a  secondhand bike 
 Bas
So sometimes it's indeed broken after like a couple of months and I need a  new tire or something.
 Bas
And then it's only another 20 or 30 euro’s
 Bas
They ask for that.
 Bas
And then if you have that more frequently then.I would definitely choose for swapbike, because they will reassure that you get repaired it for free.
 Bas
If you just behave normally with it.
 Lukas
Don’t turn it around, right?
 Lukas
Yeah, so you already said a lot of pros and cons like the repair or the price is there are there other pros and cons for you personally for getting Swap Fiets
 Bas
Well, a pro is indeed that it is.. uh.. how do you say it
 Bas
How do you say it in English?
 Lukas
Also can say it  in Dutch, maybe I understand.
 Bas
OK.
 Bas
Het is beter recyclebaar.
 Bas
More durable
 Lukas
Better recyclable 
 Bas
Durable, durable.
 Bas
Yes indeed, it's more sustainable of course than just buying a new one or buying it somewhere else.
 Bas
So OK, yeah, I think if you keep on repairing like the service they they provide it's.
 Bas
Much more sustainable.
 Bas
Than my current habit, so let you also really pro for swap fiets.
 Lukas
All right?
 Lukas
All.
 Fleur
Right and then so if you would put it on a scale like from a scale from 1 to 5 where 1 low and 5 is really high. To what extent do you think Swapfiets would provide you with a good, save or sturdy product?
 Bas
I would say as far as I know, I think a four.
 Fleur
A four
 Bas
Because I  can't give it a five because I don't know the exact details.
 Bas
Or maybe there are some things that I wouldn't like, but as far as I know they really provide good, overall bikes for through the city.
 Bas
Uh, and it's sustainable, durable.
 Bas
There I, I think it's a.
 Bas
And yeah, I would give it a four
 Fleur
And do you think that like the service of the swapfiets would also outperform or underperform private cycle?
 Bas
It will definitely outperform, because if I would go to the shop itself where they ask so much money for repairing, even for putting a chain back on the bike and I can do that myself.
 Bas
But I know they ask a lot of price, high price for that, so it's insane actually.
 Fleur
And do you think then that this also that this repair service from swap fiets, do you think it will be better or worse than just a regular bike shop.
 Bas
Wait can you repeat it?
 Fleur
Yeah, so you have to repair service from swap fiets right?
 Bas
Yes.
 Fleur
Then you also just have regular repair services.
 Bas
Oh yeah.
 Fleur
Would you think that  swap fiets’s is better or worse.
 Bas
I don't know.
 Bas
I know it's a professional team, so I think they have professional repairman, so I assume use at least as good or not worse at least
 Fleur
OK, and imagine that you would break your swap fiets or you would lose it.

 Fleur
To what extent do you think you can  trust Swapfiets to supply you  in time with a replacement.
 Bas
I don't know how many offices they have, but I think for now in Utrecht they probably have some sort of.. I don't know actually about their, how fast they could be, but I assume they make advertisement for that that they're pretty fast at your location, so I think that would be pretty good.
 Lukas
Yeah.
 Fleur
So.
Touching on the topic of like, damaging and losing the bike.

Could you tell me a bit more about how responsible you would feel for a leased  bike like swap fiets compared to your own bike?
 Bas
if I would  have my own swap bike, I would treat it as any other bike.
 Bas
I mean, it's of course it's not completely yours, but you are the one driving it and it's nicer to have a good bike.
 Bas
Can keep it like that than just do whatever you want with it and act irresponsible, even if it's not completely your own bike and you know it gets  repaired for free 
Bas
So but still I  would treat it like a normal bike, my own bike
 Lukas
So let's say you lose or damage your swap fiets 
 Lukas
How would, how would that make you feel?

How would that make you feel?

Maybe compared to your own bike.
 Bas
Well, compared to my own bike, I think I would be.
 Lukas
Yeah, yeah.
 Bas
Less irritated because of course you're a bit irritated when something happens with your bike at that moment , but you know.
 Bas
Yeah.
 Bas
It won't cost you extra money.
 Bas
But of course, if you really are in a hurry and need to be very fast, then still would be irritated, at least not for the price.
 Bas
Uh huh.
 Bas
Uh.
 Bas
It would be.
 Bas
It would be would be less irritated  then we a normal bike
 Lukas
The price is a big argument.
 Bas
And I think yeah, in this case, yes.

 Fleur
Alright, so, so with security like swapfiets really urges their users to double lock to bank, how do you feel about the company telling you what to do?
 Bas
I would, uh, I would have no problem with that.
 Bas
It's common sense  to do that inmy opinion although people don't think so, but I mean it's their product you make use of it and if you, well, want to have, well  you ask for an answer for their service, but they can also ask for your service in the other way.
 Bas
So I think it's well, common sense to actually do that.
 Bas
If they  tell you  to do that.
 Lukas
So it's a responsible thing to do you.
 Lukas
Yeah.
Think yeah, yeah.
I wanted to ask, about like we have, we have talked about like what if your swap fiets gets damaged
Lukas
To what extend  do you trust the company should get you one but this is kind of like when you already have one and it's damaged and you get a new one.

Lukas
But let's say that your breaks down and you think OK, I'm going to get a swap fiets and then from that decision to actually getting the swap fiets, is that a complicated.. Is that a complicated process in your,  in your,in your mind?
Lukas
Or how complicated would you think it would be to get a swap fiets
  Bas
Actually, I think it will be arranged with in a day
Bas
There's just a view that I have from from the company like it, It's really arranged very fast, If you want to have one, as I assume they have some in stock.
Bas
So  I assume it's pretty fast actually, like within  a day or maybe max two days you will have one.


 Fleur
And.
Lukas
And then please go ahead.
 Fleur
I think we were going to ask the same thing
 Fleur
So what do you think that they?
 Fleur
What do you think about the registration process?
 Fleur
Do you think that will be complicated or?
 Fleur
Anything similar?
 Bas
I doubt so.
 Bas
Probably it will be as all of that will be registered online .. through email and those kind of things.
 Bas
I think that works pretty fat  I don't think that's a problem whatever.
 Fleur
OK.
 Lukas
And then to get the service.
 Lukas
So like you break your bike, you're getting you like so the extra service, not like apart from the product is that complicated, Is that complicated, To use in your mind or is that, Easy peasy, lemon squeezy.
 Bas
Well, no, yes, it's just easier.
 Bas
you’r irritated that it's broken and you want it to be fixed as soon as possible, so people they don't like to go out to people who are those kind of things to get help up there.
 Bas
I would just go right away for help.
 Bas
Can you help me do this this this
 Lukas
Yeah I I I.
 Lukas
I really hate calling some like yeah.
 Bas
Yeah I know people hate it but you’re  stuck with a damaged bike and I  really don't like that.
 Lukas
Well, you're right, yeah.
 Lukas
I just want I just neither to call  or the problem
 Lukas
Alright and so oh please, do you want to?
 Fleur
you go ahead
 Lukas
So there's a.
 Lukas
As you know, when when you get your swap fiets
 Lukas
This is not a brand new bike
 Lukas
Brand new produced bike.
 Lukas
It's it's not like it doesn't have your name on it and it has most likely been used before
Lukas
What is your view on having a non first hand bike?

Lukas
You know, yeah.
 Bas
No, I definitely have no problems with that.
 Bas
At least all my bikes have been being secondhand or probably 10 hand bikes
 Lukas
1950 bike
 Bas
Yeah yeah, yeah.
 Bas
But for a lot of products I have well of course some products I have are new but I definitely have no problem with it 
 Bas
Also, if you ever  have a new bike but and then after a few months  it scratches and this  and this and it doesn't matter if someone used it before because I am sure such a company would make sure it rides perfectly.
 Bas
and if you have a problem you can call  you can still ask to fix them.
 Fleur
Yeah.
 Bas
So I wouldnt have a problem with it
 Lukas
you said a lot about no physical damage, but so currently pandemic is going on.
 Fleur
Uh huh.
 Lukas
So what about like the contamination of the bike, so like if I ask you like on the schedule one to five, how contaminated do you think that's swap fiets would be, with 5 This service is the highest level of contamination and 1 not contaminated at all.
 Bas
No, I wouldn't say it’s not contaminated
I wouldn't say it's completely free of contamination
but Uh-huh I would just let's say 1 1/2.
 Lukas
1/2 okay  yeah interesting OK nice.
 Fleur
Oh so yeah, now we kinda want to  touch upon your view of the brand..
 Lukas
Yeah.
 Fleur
So how do you feel about swap fiets as a brand?
 Fleur
whats your opinion

 Bas
So what I actually like it , i  also I have to watch this video clip but also so many more advertisements before and they really ,well , project it or something nice and sustainable.
 Bas
I've really think they put effort into that it’s  really  sustainable option.
 Bas
So overall, for me, the image of the company itself is pretty positive.
 Lukas
Yeah.
 Fleur
And then uhm  also then,  you told me like you know  a lot of persons that use the bike
Fleur
So, but if you're like closer, friends and family would start using swap fiets, would you feel more inclined to use it?
 Bas
Yeah, yeah, I've have that  with many products.
 Bas
I figure if you see people who are really close and are using it and they're happy with it, then you really already consider hey why is it so good right, right?
 Bas
why are they so happy with
 Bas
let’s see what it is
 Fleur
OK, so.
 Fleur
How do you feel about bike ownership?
 Fleur
Since you still have your own Bike, you know people who use swap fiets, so there's some sort of like attachment to your bike, for example.
 Lukas
I think it's pretty interesting because, because you said that you have like I don't have like had 20 bikes in in the in the in the in the past so far.

Lukas
Like everything is a second hand bike.
Lukas
You just switch from bike to bike  when it breaks down after a few years.


 
So I'm really interested like that.
 Bas
Oh well, it depends for my normal regular bikes that I cycle through the cities I really don't care at all, but, But if it's for other product,, let's say a car, I would have sentimental value or with My mountain shoes, I go climbing with about, but  with my bike, It's just such a regular comment thing that you use and if it works, it works, that is fine, and so I don't have to a sentimental value over a normal bike, actually.
 Fleur
OK.
 Fleur
then uhm, so can you tell me a bit about to what extent you think swap fiets does or does not fit your lifestyle, like do you but they think you have to adjust  your normal cycling lifestyle to swap fiets
 Bas
eh no, I don't, I don't, I I would think it would fit my lifestyle, although, now with corona I don't use my bike so much. And, But for instance when the bars are open again in utrecht I would definitely bike more in utrecht and go to place Yeah.
 Bas
Also in the city to go to places, so I think that it would be really it would be more suitable, but like bicycle would be then be suitable  so, but definitely swapfiets would be a suitable option.
 Lukas
I think this is really cool when you say like when, when it's back to normal life and I would use it or like them, we use it more often.
 Lukas
because we have  a question on what kind of lifestyle do you associate or like what?
 Lukas
What kind of lifestyle does swap fiets stand for as a brand in your perception? So like thinking about a normal life again and then, What would that look like if you someone has a swap fiets
 Bas
OK.
 Bas
I think swapfiets is the Lifestyle of the , let's say, for students that are about poor students to finish their studies or that live in the city and for people about just finished studying and still live in the city.
 Lukas
Uh huh.
 Bas
And I also have to work in the city so it's for
 Bas
Yeah.
 Bas
Like medium range distances or short distances in their own city for younger people, I think that's the for the people that give, that care about sustainability.
 Bas
Let's say that yes.
 Bas
Mostly, I think a city, so the bigger cities, the University  cities in the NL
 Bas
So like that, at least in the Netherlands.
 Lukas
So like a young mobile student.
 Lukas
But like Mobile that’s active
 Bas
Yeah, and then young professionals
 Lukas
Active and stuff and sustainable.
 Lukas
Active stuff sustainable.
 Lukas
Oh profession is it got?
 Lukas
Yeah, that's got additional nice yeah.
 Fleur
So I'm talking about people people who adopted swapfiets do you have  any stereotypes associated with the swap fiets
 Fleur
so for people who use it or swapfiets in general, stereotypes or like instructions and general stereotypes.
 Bas
Yeah, I would say the, The green  young professional, Yeah I I would say that busy  green young  professionals that don't have time to repair their own stuff and have actually for sure the money to do it
 Lukas
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
 Bas
For sure the money to do it.
 Bas
Yeah, mostly, I think that would be a stereotype, so let's say.
 Bas
Well, it could be mostly with young professionals in Amsterdam, for instance, that there are basically busy within sustainability.
 Fleur
And do you  think you differ from these people?
 Bas
Actually, no, I don't think I differ 
Lukas
I was going to say it
 Bas
Let's just do it.
 Lukas
You do  look like and sound like it.
 Bas
Yeah, I would probably fit that as well Yeah.
 Lukas
Yeah, see.
 Fleur
Could you then  elaborate on why you don't have a swap fiets?
 Fleur
Please let us know what are you main reasons Bas
Yeah.
 Fleur
What are your main reasons though?
 Bas
Because the current bike I have hasn't been broken yet for two years, so as long as it's works I don't need something new at when this one is over I probably would go with swap fiets, swap bike
 Fleur
OK.
 Lukas
So is that, Yeah, when you say you would rather you would consider me going for swap fiets next time.
 Lukas
Is there any Association about the subscription model so like Swap, you pay, a monthly fee instead of like a fixed price?
 Lukas
Yeah, now how do you feel about that subscription model that they have instead of buying a bike and then being done with it?
 Bas
Well, I don't, yeah, I think so many things when you get older, or when you buy things, when we're going to live somewhere, we always pay for months, so I think it wouldn't be any problem.
 Lukas
Yep.
 Bas

 Lukas
Yeah.
 Bas
So even with  some bills that you have to pay for where you can actually that amount, it's just, It’s such an easy thing
 Lukas
Yeah, yeah, so like the bike is bit of a of a necessity.
 Bas
And then so that's just that's just a normal lifestyle that you have or like.
 Lukas
Yeah, mobile phone basically yeah yeah.
 Bas
Yeah.
 Lukas
Do you think it's a.. It's a good monetary deal or is it a bad monetary deal?
 Lukas
Maybe on a scale from one to five again?
 Lukas
Where Five is best, Like, best impossible.
 Bas
Actually, it depends on.
 Bas
Well, it depends on many things.
 Bas
It depends on your income
 Bas
It also depends on how responsible you are with your bike itself.
Lukas
Uh huh.
 Bas
I would say for me, It will be a four
 Bas
, but it could be for someone else, yeah?
 Lukas
Yeah, no worries.
 Fleur
Oh, i think we have everything
 Lukas
I think I just we are  through.
 Lukas
Yeah, I think we literally.
 Lukas
Have anything on it so it's like on points like last I think last, I think we would only like to ask is that is there anything you would like to add or like it that you want to stress or that you say this hasn't been discussed and this is like a really important thing to me or.
 Bas
Not sure.
 Bas
I told you the story about the wageningen students
 Fleur
Absolutely.
 Lukas
But honestly.
 Lukas
Fantastic love it.
 Lukas
Oh nice.
 Fleur
OK, well thank you very much.
 Lukas
Thanks a lot, that was fun.
 Bas
Yeah, so like I said I'm doing.
 Fleur
When is the house waming?
 Bas
if it's a group of one or two people.
 Bas
Yeah, you can come here whenever you want, so we can arrange something.
 Lukas
Did you just move together with your girlfriend?
 Bas
Yeah, well like one month ago.
 Lukas
Oh congratulations, exactly.
 Bas
Well, thanks.
 Lukas
Yeah, fancy fancy.
 Bas
Right?
 Lukas
Alright, then I'm going to stop the recording, but thanks a lot again.
