 Fleur
Let's start, so first a little background from you. Okay, tell me your name how old you are and what your general occupation is.
 Bas
So occupation OK. Well, I am Bas. I'm 27 years old, although I'm almost turning 28, but I live in Utrecht - this is specified for Utrecht, this research, right? Yes, yeah. Well yeah, I am almost done for master studies in Wageningen but currently doing that in Utrecht, finishing my internship. Yeah, well, that's basically it for now I think.
 Fleur
OK yeah, so could you tell me a bit about your biking habits and your view on Swapfiets?
 Bas
Yeah, well, actually it's really, it's a funny story about Swapfiets in Wageningen and I don't know if you know the trend there, like what students there do with Swapbikes is that overnight they swap the bikes, you see it overnight, they swap the bikes up with all this and then turning around.. uh op de kop
 Fleur
Oh really?
 Bas
Yeah, very because it is called Swapfiets so students make fun of it and take out all the bikes and and actually they're really not happy about the students in Wageningen because they really damaged those bikes with that. And actually the police is really taking it serious and if they find you doing that, you're really getting big fine.
 Bas
Wow.
 Lukas
Does the bike does it really get broken or like ...?
 Bas
Well if you do it very, very gently, not but these students are mostly doing it in a drunk state and then it's like almost like throwing it upside down there. But other than that, my view towards Swapfiets is pretty good. I have some friends who are also using it, but I'm not .. what is currently the price for a swapfiets? Do you know?
 Fleur
It ranges from like 12 to 70 ... Yes, OK, all right, 'cause the 71 Is like an electric bike and super fancy, yeah?
Bas
Oh OK, yeah. OK yeah OK well so for me ... when I bike through the city, I use very cheap bike that I thought I got a second hand market, probably stolen. These were like 30 or 40 year euro
 Bas
Yeah.
 Bas


 Bas
So and mostly I can go on again for like at least two years of fluids.
 Bas
Ah.
 Bas
Cost less to actually have such a bike, then choose for swap fields, although they really it's really nice to include the repair and maintaining and I have to say I admit that with my bike


Yeah.
 Bas
Sometimes I don't know.
 Bas
Maybe swap fiets would be eventually cheaper than.
 Bas
I think for me not using swapfiets.
 Bas
is Cheaper than having the other bikes, but that's the main reason why I didn't choose swapfiets but.
 Bas
Other than that, but I really like the opportunity and now this whole idea they put.
 Lukas
Yeah, well, you're touching a lot about this stuff that already that we were that we're going to specify that page.
 Lukas
But maybe this.
 Lukas
Is not it might be interesting to ask now.
 Lukas
And So what if your if your current bike broke down now without knowing that you would when you say that if it's cheaper that the variation that you just have?
 Lukas
And we can go down for a small piece so we can set that up.
 Bas
Really.
 Bas
I actually went there with my neck.
 Bas
My current bank broke.
 Bas
I would really consider taking swap.
 Bas
But because I have to admit that my bag often gets broken because I shed secondhand.
 Bas
So sometimes it's indeed broken after like a couple of months and then the new tire or something.
 Bas
And then it's only another 20 or 30 years.
 Bas
They ask for that.
 Bas
And then if you have that more frequently then.
 Bas
I would definitely choose for sure, because they will reassure that you get repaired it for free.
 Bas
If you just behave normally rated.
 Lukas
Then turn it around, right?
 Lukas
Yeah, so you already said a lot of pros and cons like the repair or the price is there are there other pros and cons for you personally for forgetting his work boots?
 Bas
Really.
 Bas
Well, primer is indented, it's Harry said it's really.
 Bas
You'd have to say that in English.
 Lukas
Also said in Dutch, maybe I understand.
 Bas
OK.
 Bas
That this beta recycle bags.
 Bas
Never job yeah.
 Lukas
Will recycle therapy study.
 Bas
Durable, durable.
 Bas
Yes indeed, it's more sustainable of course than just buying a new one or buying it somewhere else.
 Bas
So OK, yeah, I think if you keep on deployment like the surface they they provide it's.
 Bas
Much more sustainable.
 Bas
Then my current habit, so let you also really pro for a swap fit.
 Lukas
All right?
 Lukas
All.
 Fleur
Right and then so if you would.
 Fleur
Put it on a scale like from skillful mental.
 Fleur
5 hour run is low and five is really high.
 Fleur
To what extent do things right Fields will provide you with a could save or like starting product?
 Bas
I would say as far as I know, I think a fork.
 Fleur
Before.
 Bas
Because I I can't give it a file because I don't know the exact details.
 Fleur
I was.
 Bas
Or maybe there are some things that I wouldn't like, but as far as America really provide goods, overall bikes rode through the city.
 Bas
Uh, it's sustainable job.
 Bas
There I, I think it's a.
 Bas
And yeah, I don't get the floor.
 Fleur
And.
 Fleur


 Fleur
And do you think that like the service of the structures would also would outperform or underperform private cycle?
 Bas
It will definitely outperform, because if I would go to the shop itself where they ask so much money for repairing, even for apartment sharing back on the bike and I can do that myself.
 Bas
But I know they ask a lot of potential high price for that, so it's insane actually.
 Fleur
And we think then also that this repair service from swap meets.
 Fleur
We think it will be better or worse than just a regular bike shop.
 Bas
Well, can you repeat it?
 Fleur
Yeah, so you have to repair service from small piece right?
 Bas
Yes.
 Fleur
They also just have regular repair services.
 Bas
Oh yeah.
 Fleur
Would you think that's what feeds this is better or worse.
 Bas
I don't know.
 Bas
I know it's a professional team, so I think they have professional repairman, so I I should use at least as good or not.
 Bas
Roll or something.
 Bas
List.
 Fleur
OK, and imagine that you would break your swap feeds or you would lose it.
 Fleur
We have to understand it.
 Fleur
If you can trust us web page to supply in time with replacements.
 Bas
I don't know how many officials they have, but I think for now and international they probably have some sort of.
 Bas
I don't know actually about their how fast they could be, but I assume.
 Bas
They make a reservation for that that they're pretty fast at your location, so I think that would be pretty good.
 Lukas
Yeah.
 Fleur
So.
 Fleur
Touching on the topic of like damaging and losing the bike.
 Fleur
Could you tell me a bit more about how responsible would feel for at least bike like swap speeds compared to your own bike?
 Bas
All I want if I have my own swap back, I would treat it as any other bag.
 Bas
I mean, it's of course it's not completely reversed, but you are the one driving it and it's nicer to have a goodbye.


Yeah.
 Bas
Can keep it like that then.
 Bas
Just.
 Bas
Do whatever we want with it.
 Bas
An act irresponsible, even if it's not completely your own like we might get you back for free.
 Bas
So but still have it.
 Bas
Children like give us a normal bike, my own bring my own bike.
 Lukas
So let's say you lose or damage is what feeds what that how?
 Lukas
How would how would that make you?
 Lukas
How would that make you feel?
 Lukas
Maybe compared to your own bike.
 Bas
Well, compared to my own work, I think I will be.
 Lukas
Yeah, yeah.
 Bas
Less irritated because of course you're a bit irritated when something happens with your bank document, but you know.
 Bas
Yeah.
 Bas
It won't cost you extra money.
 Bas
But of course, if you really are armhole and needs to be very fast, some of them still be available, at least not for the price.
 Bas
Uh huh.
 Bas
Uh.
 Bas
It would be.
 Bas
It would be would be less validated then we don't like.
 Lukas
The price is a is A is a big argument.
 Lukas
And I said.
 Lukas


 Bas
And I think yeah, in this case, yes.
 Lukas
I said
 Lukas


 Lukas
Said
 Lukas
All right?
 Fleur
Alright, so so with security like swap is really urges their users double lock to bank.
 Fleur
How do you feel about the company telling you what to do?
 Bas
I I wouldn't, I would have no problem for that.
 Bas
It's common sense to to do that to my employment or some people don't think so, but.
 Bas
I mean it's that product you make use of it an if you.
 Bas
Well, not to have then you ask for an answer for their service, but they can also ask for your service in the other way.
 Bas
So I think it's well common sense to actually do that.
 Bas
If they were trying to do that.
 Lukas
So it's a responsible thing to do you.
 Lukas
Yeah.
 Lukas


 Lukas
Think yeah, yeah.
 Lukas
I wanted to ask.
 Lukas
About like we have, we have talked about like what if your what you can swap it?
 Lukas
It's damaged.
 Lukas
Watch watch do you trust the company should get you one but this is kind of like when you already have one and it's damaged and you get a new one.
 Lukas
But let's say that you divide, breaks down and you think OK, I'm going to get this work is done.
 Lukas
And then from that decision to actually get in the spot feeds is that.
 Lukas
Is that a complicated?
 Lukas
Is that a complicated process in your in your in your mind?
 Lukas
Or is that?
 Lukas
Or how complicated would you think it would be to get this?
 Lukas
What fields?
 Bas
Actually, I think it will be arranged with him about that.
 Bas
There's just a few that I have from from the company like it.
 Bas
It's really always very fast.
 Bas
If you want to have one.
 Bas
Yeah.
 Bas


 Bas
As I assume they have some in stock.
 Bas
So I I assume it's pretty fast actually, like waiting a day or maybe next two days you will have one.
 Fleur
And.
 Fleur


 Lukas
And then please go ahead.
 Fleur
Are they going to, say, ask you something?
 Fleur
So what do you think that they?
 Fleur
What do you think about the registration process?
 Fleur
Do you think that will be complicated or?
 Fleur
Anything similar?
 Bas
I doubt so.
 Bas
Probably it will be as all of that will be registered online or through email and those kind of things.
 Bas
I think that works pretty.
 Lukas
Fun.
 Bas
First, I don't think that's a problem whatever.
 Fleur
OK.
 Lukas
And then two then to get the service.
 Lukas
So like you break your bike, you're getting you like so the extra service, not like apart from the product is that complicated.
 Lukas
Is that complicated?
 Lukas
To use in your mind or is that.
 Lukas
Easy peasy, lemon squeezy.
 Bas
Well, no, yes, it's just easier.
 Bas
Second irritated that it's broken and we want to be fixed as soon as possible, so people that don't like to go out to people who are those kind of things to get help up there.
 Bas
Right?
 Bas


 Bas
I would just go right away for help.
 Bas
Can you help me address and destination?
 Fleur
Maybe party time?
 Lukas
Yeah I I I.
 Lukas
I really hate calling some like yeah.
 Bas
Let's go ahead.
 Bas
Let's go.
 Bas
He did so, but we we were stuck with a damaged by guys really don't like that.
 Lukas
Well, you're right.


Yeah.
 Lukas
I just want I just want me to be cold node model problem so.
 Lukas
Alright and so oh please, do you want to?
 Fleur
So many years ago.
 Fleur


 Fleur
Many years ago.
 Lukas
So there's a.
 Lukas
As you know, when when you don't use or feeds right, there's a.
 Lukas
This is not a Brandy brand.
 Lukas
Brand new produced bike.
 Lukas
It's it's not like it doesn't have your name on it and Wi-Fi, so it has most likely been used before.
 Lukas
There's a.
 Lukas
Get what?
 Lukas
What is your?
 Lukas
What is your view on having a non first hand bike?
 Lukas
You know, yeah.
 Bas
No, I definitely have more problems with that.
 Bas
At least all my bags have been being secondhand or probably 10 times of hikes.
 Lukas
So I'm still 55.
 Bas
Yeah yeah, yeah.
 Bas
But for a lot of products I have well, of course some products are I don't know about that I would definitely have no problem with that.
 Bas
Also, if you ever move back, but you know that what it meant when it too much, she scratches and days and days and it doesn't matter if it existed before because I.
 Bas
No, not such a company would make sure it writes perfectly.
 Bas
African is validate and if you have a problem with this column, you can still also fix them.
 Fleur
Yeah.
 Bas
So I get another problem with Apple.
 Lukas
We said a lot about no physical damage, but so currently pandemic is going on.
 Fleur
Uh huh.
 Lukas
So what about like I don't know contamination of the bike, so like if I ask you like on the schedule one to five, how contaminated do you think that's what we say you get will be, you know we're like 5.
 Bas
No, I wish.
 Lukas
This service is the highest level of contamination.
 Bas
Yeah.
 Lukas
OK, you know not one not contaminated at all.
 Bas
I.
 Bas
I wouldn't say it's completely.
 Bas
This contaminated water.


Uh-huh
 Bas
I I would just let's say 1 1/2.
 Lukas
1/2 Nothing yeah interesting OK nice.
 Fleur
Oh so yeah, no when I kind of touch from the view of the bands.
 Lukas
Yeah.
 Fleur
So how do you feel about swap fields as a gram?
 Fleur
So appealing?
 Fleur
Right?
 Bas
So what I actually like it floor also I have to watch this video clip but also so many more advertisements before and they really projected or something nice and sustainable.
 Bas
I've really felt put effort into that.
 Bas
It's really sustainable option.
 Bas
So overall, for me, the image of the company itself is pretty positive.
 Lukas
Yeah.
 Fleur
And then I also then, like you know, a lot of persons that use the bank.
 Fleur
So, but if you're like closer, friends and family would start using swap fields.
 Fleur
Would you feel more inclined to use it?
 Bas
Yeah, yeah, I've met with many products.
 Bas
I figure if you see people who are really close and are using it and they're happy with it, then we really already consider her right, right?
 Bas
So drivers are happy with it.
 Bas
That's true, not always so.
 Fleur
OK, so.
 Fleur
How do you feel about bike ownerships?
 Fleur
Since you still have your own Bible, you know people who use rapid, so there's some sort of like attachment to a bike, for example.
 Bas
I think it's.
 Lukas
Pretty interesting because because you said that you have like I don't have like had 20 bikes in in the in the in the in the past so far.
 Lukas
Like everything is a second hand bike.
 Lukas
You just switch from bike to bike breaks down after a few years.
 Lukas
Yes.
 Lukas


 Lukas
So I'm really interested like that.
 Bas
Oh well, it depends fully.
 Bas
Normal regular bikes that I cycle through the cities I really don't care at all, but.
 Bas
But if it's problem other project, let's say a car, I would have sentimental value.
 Bas
I.
 Bas


 Bas
Of course not all of it.
 Bas
My mountain shoes.
 Bas
I go climbing with about with my bike.
 Bas
It's just such a regular comment thing that you use and it works, it works.
 Bas
That is fine, and so I don't have to get in touch with sentimental value over a normal bike, actually.
 Fleur
OK.
 Fleur
Complete
 Lukas
Yeah, I see.
 Fleur
Z so can you tell me a bit about to what extent you think strategies does or does not fit your lifestyle, but they think you have to address your normal cycling lifestyle to stop it.
 Bas
Or no, I don't, I don't, I I would think it would fit by large table.
 Bas
Now let's go.
 Bas
I don't use my bank so much.
 Bas
And.
 Bas
But won't process the bar side open again here.
 Bas
Interest, however, definitely.
 Bas
There's like a lot more.


Yeah.
 Bas
Also in the city to go to places, so I think that it would be really it would be more suitable, but like bicycle would be done so, but definitely short, which I think would be suitable option.
 Lukas
I think this is really cool when you say like when when it's back to normal life and I would use it or like them, we use it more often.
 Lukas
We have a question on what kind of lifestyle do you associate or like what?
 Lukas
What kind of lifestyle does swap food stand for as a brand in your interceptions?
 Bas
Do you?
 Lukas
So like thinking about a normal life again and then?
 Lukas
What would that look like if you someone has a small piece here?
 Bas
OK.
 Bas
Hello.
 Bas
Frank swap fixes.
 Bas
Lifestyle there, let's say, or students that are about to finish their studies or that live in the city an old people about just finished studying and still lives in the city.


Uh huh.
 Lukas
Uh huh.
 Bas
And I also have to work in the city so it's 4.
 Bas
Yeah.
 Bas
Like medium range distances or short distances in their own city for younger people, I think that's the problem.
 Bas
The people that give that care about sustainability.
 Bas
Let's say that yes.
 Bas
Mostly, I think a city, so the bigger cities, the University setting some elements.
 Bas
So like that, at least in the Netherlands.
 Lukas
So like a young mobile student.
 Lukas
But like Mobile isn't like it.
 Bas
Yeah, and then your professional chef.
 Lukas
Active and stuff and sustainable.
 Lukas
Active stuff sustainable.
 Lukas
Oh profession is it got?
 Lukas
Yeah, that's got additional nice yeah.
 Fleur
So I'm talking about people.
 Fleur
With cops we think about it like they don't have any stereotypes associated with the slot priests.
 Fleur
So for every user or like instructions and general stereotypes.
 Bas
Yeah, I would say there.
 Bas
The Bruins young professional.
 Bas
Uh, huh, yeah. Well we.
 Bas
Yeah I I would say that basically green run professionals that don't have time to repair their own stuff and and and have actually.
 Lukas
Yeah, yeah.


Yeah.
 Bas
For sure the money to do it.
 Bas
Yeah, mostly, I think that would be a stereotype, so let's say.
 Bas
Well, it could be mostly with young professionals in Amsterdam, for instance, that there are basically better rating sustainability.
 Fleur
And they think you different from these people.
 Bas
Actually, no, I don't think I get it, it's.
 Bas
OK, let's just do it.
 Bas


 Lukas
Going to show me how.
 Bas
Let's just do it.
 Lukas
You don't look like I'll sound like it.
 Bas
Yeah, I would probably fit.


Yeah.
 Lukas
Yeah, see.
 Fleur
The country then elaborate on why you don't have this.
 Fleur
Please let us what is your?
 Bas
Yeah.
 Fleur
What are your main reasons though?
 Bas
The cast my the current bike I have hasn't been broken yet for two years, so as long as it's works I don't need so we know that when this one is over I probably would go with super hot spot which so bag.
 Fleur
OK.
 Lukas
So is that.
 Lukas
Yeah, when you say you would rather you would consider me going for pizza next time.
 Lukas
Is there any Association about the subscription model so like Swap, PTP, a monthly fee instead of like a fixed price?
 Lukas
Is there anything?
 Lukas
Yeah, now how do you feel about that subscription model that they have instead of buying a bike and then being done with it?
 Bas
Well, I don't, yeah.
 Bas
I think so many things when you get over.
 Bas
I think so.
 Bas
When we're going to live somewhere, we always pay for months, so I think it wouldn't be any problem.
 Bas
Yep.
 Bas


 Lukas
Yeah.
 Bas
So we can get some bills that you have to pay for where you can actually that amount, it's just.
 Bas
I'm fixing my phone so I think.
 Lukas
Yeah, yeah, so like the bike is bit of a of a necessity.
 Lukas
And then so that's just that's just a normal lifestyle that you have or like.
 Lukas
Yeah, mobile phone basically yeah yeah.
 Bas
Yeah.
 Bas


 Lukas
Let's see.
 Lukas


 Lukas
See.
 Lukas
Interesting.
 Lukas
Generally, is that so you say you would?
 Lukas
You would do it maybe?
 Lukas
Or consider it so it's a.
 Lukas
Do you think it's a?
 Lukas
It's a good monetary deal or is it a bad monetary deal?
 Lukas
Maybe on a scale from one to five again?
 Lukas
Where?
 Lukas
Five is best.
 Lukas
Like, best impossible.
 Bas
Actually, it depends on.
 Bas
Well, it depends on many things.
 Bas
It depends on your encoding.
 Bas
It also depends on how responsible you are with your bank itself.


Uh huh.
 Bas
I would say for me.
 Fleur
It will be.
 Bas
Before, but it could be for someone else, yeah?
 Lukas
Yeah, no worries.
 Lukas
I mean I will ask him today.
 Fleur
Oh, did we have anything OK?
 Lukas
I think I just go through.
 Lukas
Yeah, I think we literally.
 Lukas
Have anything on it so it's like on points like last I think last, I think we would only like to ask is that is there anything you would like to add or like it that you want to stress or that you say this hasn't been discussed and this is like a really important thing to me or.
 Bas
Not sure.
 Bas
I told you the story about passionate students.
 Bas
But Sebastian.
 Bas


 Fleur
Absolutely.
 Lukas
But honestly.
 Lukas
Fantastic love it.
 Lukas
Oh nice.
 Fleur
OK, well thank you very much.
 Lukas
Thanks a lot, that was fun.
 Bas
Yeah, so like I said I'm doing.
 Fleur
Now we're running as a house warming 2nd.
 Bas
People are like if it's a group of one or two people.
 Bas
Yeah, you can come here whenever you want, so we can arrange something.
 Lukas
Did you just move together with your girlfriend?
 Bas
Yeah, well like one month ago.
 Lukas
Oh congratulations, exactly.
 Bas
Well, thanks.
 Lukas
Yeah, that's fancy fancy.
 Bas
Right?
 Lukas
Alright, then I'm going to stop the recording, but thanks a lot again.
 Fleur
Hello.


Yeah.
 Bas
Yes.
