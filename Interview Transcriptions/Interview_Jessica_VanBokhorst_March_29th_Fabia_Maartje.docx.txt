 Speaker 2
OK, so hello Jessica, welcome. Thank you for joining. So we are doing the interviews for qualitative research course and it's we're researching the.
 Speaker 1
Thanks.
 Speaker 2
Non adoption of swapfiets with specifically. So we look at different types of barriers, like which could contribute to non adoption of this access sharing service and access sharing means like. That you all like lease a bike that is being used in this segment, your own and. They also like. Looking at the ownership versus non ownership of bikes with them. Yeah, so thank you for joining. Uhm, have you looked at the videoclip that I sent you?
 Speaker 1
Yes, I've seen it.
 Speaker 2
OK nice perfect. Uhm so to start. Uh, we are very interested in your background, so like could you state your name. How old are you and what is your general occupation?
 Speaker 1
I'm Jessica, I'm 25 years old and I'm a master student medical student.
 Speaker 2
OK, nice thank you. So like first to start like more general. Like, could you describe your biking habits? Like, do you own a bike? How often do you use it?
 Speaker 1
Yes.
 Speaker 2
And could you tell? Us a little bit more about that.
 Speaker 1
I own two bikes. Especially like 3. 2 here in Utrecht and one at home, but with my parents.  So I own three bikes. Now with Corona, I don't use the bike very often. But before you use the bike to get to the station to go to my internship or use my bike to go to friends. I don't use the bus very often so we always my bike. I own a race bike and so I go cycling once so week with that one.
 Speaker 2
Oh yeah, yeah nice. Oh, nice nice. And so yes, go ahead, maartje.
 Speaker 3
You can guess. Biking is a sport that's a very good addition.
 Speaker 2
Is your like personal bike? New or secondhand?
 Speaker 1
My own bike, my Citybike? It is my. Yeah, it got it when I was eleven.
 Speaker 2
Oh wow.
 Speaker 1
I've I'm using bike which I have for very very long time nice.
 Speaker 2
You're very lucky that it hasn't been stolen yet.
 Speaker 1
Yes. 
 Speaker 3
And did you choose this option when the reason or was it just? Given to you.
 Speaker 1
And the other one which is now at home with my parents is the my old one, which I had here before. And that is the old one of my grandma. It is. Was a little bit broken, but this is a good bike right now, but this one was better so I switched it.
 Speaker 2
Ah, nice. 
 Speaker 3
Would you generally have second hand bikes? If I hear correctly correctly. 
 Speaker 1
Yeah. Right. 
 Speaker 2
And so we are a research is of course specifically about swapfiets. Do you already have some like views on Swap fiets? Like, how would you describe your general view on the product and the brand?
 Speaker 1
Well, I think it's a good option when your bike is often broken or stolen. But it's very expensive for a bike. For a month a year, so it's a good service I think, but it's too expensive for me.
 Speaker 3
OK. So that's that are also your pros and cons. If you would have to name.
 Speaker 1
Yeah.
 Speaker 2
Very good. So right now we're going a little bit like into the different types of barriers that would be interesting for getting a Swapfiets. Firstly, you mentioned like as a the biggest con, the money concerns.
 Speaker 1
Yes.
 Speaker 2
How do you feel about a subscription model? For example, for bike better than buying a bicycle yourself?
 Speaker 1
You mean like you have to pay like $14.00 or euros a month. So it's like a 160 a year. So you can buy two bicycles secondhand, I don't know. I wouldn't do it if I needed the bike.
 Speaker 2
And is this specifically like adding up. Yeah, so this specifically adding up and like on a scale from one to five, where five is the best. Do you think that Swapfiets is presenting a good monetary deal?
 Speaker 1
A good what?
 Speaker 2
Monetary deal.
 Speaker 1
No. So too.
 Speaker 2
OK. Uhm? So.
 Speaker 3
We have some other barriers we have. We have seven barriers that we can go into, so we now had. Have done monetary like the financial part. Maybe we can do something about the complexity of the process because it's very different from buying a second hand or even a new bicycle.
 Speaker 1
You can. You
 Speaker 3
So what do you? What would you say of the registration process or or yeah, do you think it's more complicated than what you're used to now? 
 Speaker 1
Honest, to be honest I really don't know the registry form. I think it's not that complicated I think. But I really don't know.
 Speaker 3
Yeah.
 Speaker 2
Yeah, I see. An and would this be something that would prevent you, for example from getting swapped fiets next to?
 Speaker 3
If it's actually, yeah, if it will be cheaper, but you done state, would you wouldn't find it too complex to use it just because of how the subscription based model is providing this service or this product to you.
 Speaker 1
No, I think the the model and the service is good, like when others have broken or damaged their bike, the Swapfiets team will get it really fast and switch it. So that's a good service I think. Then for me, I've got a good bike, so I don't want to switch it. For now.
 Speaker 2
I see. Uh, so that leads a little bit also into one of our other barriers.  Like the reliability of the brand and product. Like more generally, what do you think about swap fiets, reliability and performance?
 Speaker 1
Uhm?
 Speaker 3
Like, do you think that this bicycle will be good, safe, sturdy in comparison to your secondhand bike? Do you think it would be better or?
 Speaker 1
The quality of the bike itself you mwan. Well, I think it is a good simple bike which can be repaired simply. So it's a good bike. I think, and maybe better than a second hand. Yeah, because it's a new one, yeah?
 Speaker 3
Yeah, and then you of course also have this service part of it. Yeah, that they help you with maintenance and if something is broken, do you think that that is? Yeah? Very nice or that out would outperform or how would it perform in comparison to secondhand bike and fixing it yourself?
 Speaker 1
Well, if you're a small piece is broken, they come into her house, fix it, or switch it so you don't have to do anything. So it's very easy. And when your office bike is broken, you have to fix it yourself so it goes much more time or you bring it to a well, a bike shop or something. And they fix it for you. So it is small. Takes more time. But it is.  The same price, I think. Well, no swap fiets is you don't have to pay for a broken, so that is cost effective I think.
 Speaker 2
Yeah. And yeah, would you should trust them to supply you in time with the replacement bike in case your bike get broken.
 Speaker 1
Yeah, I think so. They give you another one. I think. I really don't know.
 Speaker 2
And this is like based on, for example, the number of people that you see using swap fiets or. You just the  brands in general?
 Speaker 1
What is based on this?
 Speaker 2
Oh, that's like so you say, yeah, I do trust them to supply you with replacement in time. But like like, what reasons do you have for this? 
 Speaker 1
I havent heard someone who doenst get a new good bike. Some stories it went well, but I don't remember them anymore, but I think it if it wouldn’t be a good I would remember it.
 Speaker 3
Yeah, so you know some more people like family or friends that are using Swapfiets?
 Speaker 1
Yes, your friends and.
 Speaker 3
Does that make your image of swap fiets different? Does that influence you? Or what do you think about?
 Speaker 1
No, it's still the same at this for the expensive, it's good service.
 Speaker 2
Have you actually ridden on a Swapfiets one time , or.
 Speaker 1
nope 
 Speaker 2
Yeah, we we had a previous guy in an interview who talked about the riding on a Swapfiets. 
 Speaker 1
Really, yeah, well did he said about it. 
 Speaker 2
Uh, that he was actually impressed with the bike.
 Speaker 1
Good to hear.
 Speaker 2
Yeah, so you mentioned previously that you associate Swapfiets with like a monthly subscription fee and like convenience with replacing a bike. But like how would you feel about swapfiets as a brand? Like what things come to mind? As well.
 Speaker 1
You mean what is popped in my mind if I think about swapfiets, right? Yeah, well at the blue bike with. But it can be red or black with the blue band, the blue wheels. Well, you have the normal one and the expensive one. A lot of same bikes in the city. You can’t find it back and I think. You can say too many.
 Speaker 3
But in comparison of having your own bike like how do you feel about like ownership? Do you feel like that? Should be part of your like you would really like to own your your own bike, or wouldn't you mind having the same bike as everyone else at the University for example?
 Speaker 1
Well, I don't mind if I don't own the bike because I I well I use it, but I don't care if I own it. It has to work. And same bike. Doesn't matter. Until you want to find it back, yeah.
 Speaker 3
That comes in handy. Very nice.
 Speaker 2
So were also very interested in for example, if you lose it like. And you're associated with responsibility with the bike in a general question, like . Tell me how responsible you would feel for a leased bike like swapfiets compared to for example, a bike you own.
 Speaker 1
Well, I don't know the rights or the rules you have when you own or use a swapfiets if you lose it or if it is stolen if you have to pay, they give another one. I don't know so. Maybe you can tell me that and then. I can give you an answer.
 Speaker 2
Maartje or do you know, do you know the specifics from this?
 Speaker 3
There for certain, the two lock principle. That if you don't lock it with both the key chain and the normal lock. And you need both keys that you don't that you need to pay for the bike. Yeah for sure . So they they have some rules about really asking of you to put effort into safely stalling the bike, but if you've done all those via the rules. I thought that you just get a new one because then it's not your fault. But if you don't have two keys. Then they for sure say that you have to pay something to get a new one, but I don't know the exact rules about damage, losing and breaking.
 Speaker 1
Yeah, I can imagine that you can't prove the second lock is on the bike and on something else because you have to key, but you don't know if it's just on the bike or on something else.
 Speaker 3
With that Yeah, so wondering about that how they enforce that, so I I'm not sure about that but. Would you then for example, feel less frustrated or stressed if you lose or damage the swapfiets and have less? Yeah less.
 Speaker 1
So if I have to use two times a lock and I have the chance that I have to pay the whole bike back. I will be more careful, but I really don't want to be. The second one, when you lose it well then it's fine, but I can't imagine they don't do that.
 Speaker 3
The spread of their bikes also helps. I think with getting the bike not stolen because it's so so obvious thereby, so I don't hear often that it gets stolen less less often than normal bikes actually. Yeah, yes. You said like in comparison to your own bike, you know what you have if you damage it that you have to repair it and you like that better than don't knowing exactly what what. The results will be if damaging or losing swapfiets that is. Not a good thing in your.
 Speaker 1
Being undermined I think when your swapfiets. A damaged and they fix it. It will be fine. I believe in them. They've learned through it so. I think it's fine.
 Speaker 2
And you know, we already talked about a little bit of like the double locking, and that's what it's ask you to do that. Like how would you feel about a company telling you what to do in relation to the product that you? Use.
 Speaker 1
And I've got imagined that I have agreement with them because I. Owner overused a bike but I don't want to be told what to do so I really don't want it.
 Speaker 1
And yeah, if you go to agreement and you do that. But yeah, I don't want to do anything.
 Speaker 3
Interesting, nice. I haven't heard that before, so that's good. We also still have a question about contamination, but that's more because we well would like to know your answer, of course. So on a scale from one to five, how contaminated would you think that a shop? It would be? 5 is the highest level of contamination, so that you think that it has been used before.  Or one that it hasn't been used before or. So would you mind like you own?
 Speaker 1
Maybe yes because you are paying for very high price so you hope it is a good bike. If it's used for like one year and it is still the same goodbye, I wouldn't mind.
 Speaker 3
Yeah, so it's more to qualityi then the idea of that it has been used.
 Speaker 1
Yeah it is the quality, yeah?
 Speaker 3
Yeah, you really want a proper bike for the money that you pay.
 Speaker 1
Yep.
 Speaker 2
Yeah, makes sense.
 Speaker 2
Another like one of the loss barriers actually ever interested in is. Compatibility, which corresponds to whether swapfiets fits with, like your user patterns, lifestyle or social norms. So my first question, tell me to what extent you think that swapfiets does or does not fit with your lifestyle.
 Speaker 1
Well, if I can ride this bike it will fit with my life so I don't know better than that.
 Speaker 3
Yeah, so you would. You don't feel like that you had to adjust anything to like put a swapfiets into your normal daily programs and stuff like that. Like you don't feel that anything changes.
 Speaker 3
Nope. Yes.
 Speaker 2
And why do you then think that swapfiets is adopted by fellow students? Or especially young professionals.
 Speaker 1
And well, I think the most students are another careful with the bike, so they lose it. Break it so it's just easy way to bike. Which works actually works.
 Speaker 2
And how do you differ from them?
 Speaker 1
Well. Eventually my bike is still working, so. 
 Speaker 2
You're doing something good. No drunk falling from the bike. Like a couple of months ago and it's kind of escalated and I was drunk. And then I biked home. And then I fell twice. Back to the interview. So like, do you have any stereotypes? Associated with the swapfiets, like for example.
 Speaker 1
Drunk people. Young students maybe?
 Speaker 2
And like one like other. Questions since you already have used your bike like. Thank you. Quite a long time. Do you feel attached to your bike.
 Speaker 1
Maybe yes.
 Speaker 2
And in what way?
 Speaker 1
Well. I look through that. Well, it's a blue bike and I love blue so I don't know. It's just my bike.
 Speaker 3
All right?
 Speaker 2
Would you feel attached to a surface bike.
 Speaker 1
You know what? Because everyone else has this bike, so it's just not only my bike, it's. Everyone's bike. So I get a feeling it is everyone's bike.
 Speaker 2
Yeah. So let's see. If we have been through everything. Do you have anything maartje?
 Speaker 3
I just scanned the whole list an I think. We covered sort of everything except for. If we'd like to add. Or would like to remark anything left that you would like to about this topic about your bike?
 Speaker 2
Well, I don't think so.
 Speaker 3
Very good. This will give us more insight into non doctors I would say.
 Speaker 1
Do you have to do this topic? Have you chosen it by yourself or?
 Speaker 3
Sharing surface and then we came up with swap. It's part of our own because it's it's like very new but so big already.
 Speaker 1
Can imagine yeah.
 Speaker 2
Actually, a lot of people who use swapfiets.  The few I know they stopped using it like. A few months ago or something.
  Speaker 2
I just know my some roommates that use Swapfiets but. Apart from that, only internationals in Amsterdam. but thank you very much for the interview. 
  Speaker 1
Goodluck with your projects.
 Speaker 1
Thank you.
