Hello.
 Sprecher 1
OK.
 Sprecher 2
Yeah.
 Sprecher 1
Never tight.
 Sprecher 3
Daily submit.
 Sprecher 1
Who yeah?
 Sprecher 2
Boy
 Sprecher 1
Explain me what Equen Studio notes from Fleur he think carefully about content.
 Sprecher 2
Yeah, I'm sorry.
 Sprecher 1
Boy
 Sprecher 1
We started interviewing at Angle Stone.
 Sprecher 2
Yep.
 Sprecher 1
Yeah, yeah, and there's not on that bombshell.
 Sprecher 1
Flierl yeah more bigger.
 Sprecher 3
Oh yes, so first we would like to have a general introduction of yourself.
 Sprecher 3
So OK, tell me your name, how old you are and what your general occupation is.
 Sprecher 2
My name is Lisa owner. I'm 23 years old and I.
 Sprecher 2
Am a student.
 Sprecher 2
I am working on an internship right now in enter them.
 Sprecher 1
What do you study?
 Sprecher 2
And I love you too.
 Sprecher 2
Yeah, I just finished my bachelors and I'm going to start my Masters in September, but now I have a voluntary internship.
 Sprecher 1
And a Bachelor what?
 Sprecher 2
Herbology.
 Sprecher 1
Biology.
 Sprecher 3
Yeah, so a little bit about why you do the interview, so we're following of course research methods and we have to write a paper about the sharing economy and we chose to write something about in an adoption.
 Sprecher 3
Son of a chair of the sharing economy.
 Sprecher 3
An in this gauge.
 Sprecher 3
Drop feeds and yeah.
 Sprecher 3
So since you are not a Doctor of Sport feeds we would like to get your views on it and why you didn't adopt it.
 Sprecher 3
So we have a set of questions for you.
 Sprecher 3
So let's see.
 Sprecher 3
But what are your biking habits and what do you think of swap feeds?
 Sprecher 2
Uh, my biking habits I I used to bike to uni everyday but now.
 Sprecher 2
In their Corona times, I don't have to anymore.
 Sprecher 2
I.
 Sprecher 2
OK.
 Sprecher 2
AU City Bike ride, about 20-30 minutes.
 Sprecher 2
As I use it quite often, I also use it to go to my sports.
 Sprecher 2
Which is.
 Sprecher 2
20 minute bike ride.
 Sprecher 2
And now also to go to new grocery shopping.
 Sprecher 2
And what was the other question?
 Sprecher 2
Again, I'm sorry.
 Sprecher 3
And what do you think about swap sheets, oh.
 Sprecher 2
I I think it's very nice for.
 Sprecher 2
General people I think my own bike is.
 Sprecher 2
I've had it for a couple of years now and it just works fine, so that's why I don't really use it.
 Sprecher 2
But I do know quite a lot of people who do use it.
 Sprecher 2
I believe it is quite expensive. I thought it was about €12.00 per month. I could be wrong but.
 Sprecher 2
Thanks.
 Sprecher 2


 Sprecher 2
I think that is quite expensive.
 Sprecher 2
And but
 Sprecher 2
The bikes are really nice.
 Sprecher 3
And so even though you know a lot of people that are owner swap feeds, you still have your own bike.
 Sprecher 3
So do you have some kind of feeling tired towards heavy tourist bike ownership?
 Sprecher 3
Like do you attach to your own bike?
 Sprecher 3
Do you think it's important?
 Sprecher 3
To have your own bike.
 Sprecher 2
Ann
 Sprecher 2
No, I don't think so.
 Sprecher 2
I think it could be nice to rent a bike because then you also have the.
 Sprecher 2
Additional.
 Sprecher 2
Are you call it?
 Sprecher 2
Like when your lamp is broken, they automatically fix it.
 Sprecher 2
Instead of you have.
 Sprecher 1
And they guarantee.
 Sprecher 2
To do it yourself.
 Sprecher 2
Yeah, exactly, and with your own bike you just have to pay for it yourself, so I think it's not really better to have your own bike.
 Sprecher 3
OK.
 Sprecher 3
Yeah.
 Sprecher 3
And do you think then, that the surface of swap fields would outperform or underperform?
 Sprecher 3
Like regular repair service.
 Sprecher 2
Uhm?
 Sprecher 2
Yeah, that's a tough question because you do have to pay for it, kinda.
 Sprecher 2
But also not so I think if they would lower it to about 10 years a month instead of 12, which I think it is.
 Sprecher 2
Then I think it would outperform regular services.
 Sprecher 2
So it really depends for me at least at the price.
 Sprecher 3
And also the repair, do you think it would be better with swap meets than a regular bike repair shop for example?
 Sprecher 2
Not necessarily, but I do have kind of a belief that regular shelves.
 Sprecher 2
Do not fix your bike's population once here because they want you to come back. I don't know if that's true, but I just.
 Sprecher 2
Yes.
 Sprecher 2


 Sprecher 2
Have a feeling about it.
 Sprecher 1
Huh?
 Sprecher 2
Always breaks a couple of days later, again at the same place or whatever, so I didn't think that their repair would be.
 Sprecher 1
Interesting.
 Sprecher 2
Better, yeah.
 Sprecher 1
So with that in mind, do you think that swap feeds would then provide you with a a good, safe, sturdier product, better than like the average bike?
 Sprecher 2
Yes, yes.
 Sprecher 3
Oh
 Sprecher 3
OK.
 Sprecher 1
Could you suppose your bike would breakdown now?
 Sprecher 1
Would you consider getting a swap feeds?
 Sprecher 3
I.
 Sprecher 2
Yeah, I.
 Sprecher 2
I think so for a couple of months maybe.
 Sprecher 2
Uh, but.
 Sprecher 2
Eventually, I think the price ideways it.
 Sprecher 2
If you pay for a bike at once.
 Sprecher 2
Maybe 2.
 Sprecher 2
Overlap sometime.
 Sprecher 3
OK, then you just stated like a con of the swap feeds.
 Sprecher 3
What are according to you the pros and cons of adopting a swap piece?
 Sprecher 2
Uhm?
 Sprecher 2
Cons I think the price again an.
 Sprecher 2
Praise Ann.
 Sprecher 2
You will get a new bike.
 Sprecher 2
I think if yours was stolen and you don't have to pay as much for the old bike, I think it was like that but.
 Sprecher 2
I think you had to pay some kind of amount of about €50 if you have a double lock on it. An €100 or something if you don't.
 Sprecher 2
Have a double lock on it, you're correct.
 Sprecher 2
Uhm?
 Sprecher 2
So I think that's both pro and Con account because you do have to pay it.
 Sprecher 2
True.
 Sprecher 2
Even though you can buy a bike 100 years for yourself an the pro that you automatically get a new one instead of searching for another and the repairs, I think.
 Sprecher 2
Would be better for the swap.
 Sprecher 2
It's so bad.
 Sprecher 1
Yeah.
 Sprecher 1
Hey.
 Sprecher 3
OK.
 Sprecher 1
With the.
 Sprecher 1
Given that they repair your bike a lot or well that they repair your bike, that that is included in the service, would you feel more responsible using the bike or like tell me about how responsible you would feel for a leased bike like swap feats compared to a bike that you own?
 Sprecher 2
I think I will feel less responsible with the swap bike.
 Sprecher 2
I think mainly because you have to pay for yourself with your own like.
 Sprecher 2
An I'm student, Sir.
 Sprecher 1
So you say you wouldn't mind just like biking, a little edgier, crashing into walls, or.
 Sprecher 1
But like where?


Yeah.
 Sprecher 2
Right?
 Sprecher 1
Where would you draw the line in that in that regard?
 Sprecher 3
Uh.
 Sprecher 2
I don't think I really AM.
 Sprecher 2
Like
 Sprecher 2
Crashing my bike, but.
 Sprecher 2
I don't know actually, because also that the fact that you have to pay extra if you buy guest code and then you would always double lucky and I never do with my own bike, so maybe I'm not that cautious with my own brake.
 Sprecher 1
Yeah.
 Sprecher 2
Actually I think I would be more cautious with a small plates.
 Sprecher 1
Really, and why?
 Sprecher 2
Yeah.
 Sprecher 4
Yeah.
 Sprecher 3
Yeah.
 Sprecher 3


 Sprecher 2
Because of the extra.
 Sprecher 2
Money you have to pay them.
 Sprecher 1
That's it.
 Sprecher 3
Assorted repairs.
 Sprecher 2
I don't know.
 Sprecher 2
I don't think you can do anything to prevent your buy gritty from getting some regular damage.
 Sprecher 1
And then.
 Sprecher 1
And is it really then a matter of that you you pay for this service or that it costs extra?
 Sprecher 1
Or is it?
 Sprecher 1
Does it also have to do with the fact that there's a company behind it, or that the bike might be used by other people or?
 Sprecher 1
Ann
 Sprecher 2
And just a cost.
 Sprecher 1
Just the cost, all right?
 Sprecher 3
And like how do you feel?


Ah.
 Sprecher 3
Because swap feeds really urges their users to double lock their bites.
 Sprecher 3
And how do you feel about the company telling you what to do?
 Sprecher 1
Uh.
 Sprecher 2
Yeah, I I don't really mind.
 Sprecher 1
You think it's a you think it's it's?
 Sprecher 1
It's a I hate the liquor.
 Sprecher 2
I don't think it's necessary.
 Sprecher 2


 Sprecher 2
Don't think it's necessary.
 Sprecher 2
Yeah, and I also don't think it's necessary to explicitly say that you have to double lock your bike, 'cause if they do have that extra fee then I think you would automatically double lock it.
 Sprecher 1
OK.
 Sprecher 1
Interesting.
 Sprecher 2
So.
 Sprecher 1
Flair.
 Sprecher 3
Oh, would you feel guilty if you would damage the bike or lose the bike and why?
 Sprecher 3
And also in comparison to your own bike.
 Sprecher 3
Ann
 Sprecher 2
I think with a swap face I would be more feeling guilty and with my own bike more angry at myself I think.
 Sprecher 3
Yeah, I don't know.
 Sprecher 2
And why?
 Sprecher 2
The guilty also guilty towards myself.
 Sprecher 2
Instead of two words, the company.
 Sprecher 2
The girls feeling of losing that extra money?
 Sprecher 2
Yeah, OK.
 Sprecher 1
Because because.
 Sprecher 2
There's nothing to waste a company city almost.
 Sprecher 1
Yeah, OK, so so so it's yeah so it it yeah no that then then I'm filling in for you for you that you feel guilty for for the service but only because this now cost you cost you extra money yeah.
 Sprecher 1
Hey.
 Sprecher 1


 Sprecher 2
Yeah.
 Sprecher 1
Yeah.
 Sprecher 3
Oh so yeah, maybe we can touch a bit on the complexity of swap feeds, so can you tell me a bit about how complicated it would be to get a swap piece?
 Sprecher 2
Uh.
 Sprecher 1
How complicated do you think it would be?
 Sprecher 2
I didn't think it would be kinda complicated.
 Sprecher 2
I never really looked into it, but I think they have a decent website where you can.
 Sprecher 2
I don't know.
 Sprecher 2
Call them or make a reservation online.
 Sprecher 2
I don't know, I'm not sure and I do believe also that they have shelves, but I don't know where to find them.
 Sprecher 3
Yes, they have shops.
 Sprecher 2
That's probably yeah.
 Sprecher 2
I think the same with renting a bike on a holiday.
 Sprecher 2
Just walk in and.
 Sprecher 2
Get it, yeah?
 Sprecher 1
Easy peasy, no problem.
 Sprecher 1
Yeah.
 Sprecher 3
And what about the registration process?
 Sprecher 3
Do you think that would be complicated?
 Sprecher 1
I think it would take a long time.


Oh
 Sprecher 2
I never, I don't think so.
 Sprecher 1
That is an answer.
 Sprecher 1
That's very much.
 Sprecher 1
It's a very useful answer.
 Sprecher 1
Because it it, yeah.
 Sprecher 1
You definitely see swap fees as something easy to get.
 Sprecher 1
An.
 Sprecher 2
Yeah.
 Sprecher 1
Also, would you call it a a quick fix?
 Sprecher 1
Almost.
 Sprecher 2
Yeah, definitely.
 Sprecher 1
OK.
 Sprecher 2
I'm actually more worried with these kind of things that you get monthly.
 Sprecher 2
That ending such a subscription is more difficult than starting one.
 Sprecher 1
And how so?
 Sprecher 2
It's always kind of awkward, I think, to call them or go to them, to explain yourself why you want to stop, or sometimes I think.
 Sprecher 2
Companies also make it difficult for you.
 Sprecher 2
Because they keep pushing you to continue.
 Sprecher 2
But I do not really expect that from them.
 Sprecher 1
So with that have to do with the fact that you're.
 Sprecher 1
They want you to keep the swap feeds.
 Sprecher 2
Yes.
 Sprecher 1
Yeah.
 Sprecher 1
OK.
 Sprecher 1
So how how would you feel if you say you have a swap sheet subscription?
 Sprecher 1
And you decide that it's getting too expensive or you want a regular bike.
 Sprecher 1
And how would you feel calling them up or doing it online and having to tell them that you no longer are in need of their service?
 Sprecher 1
Yes.
 Sprecher 1


 Sprecher 2
Yeah, I think I would procrastinate it.
 Sprecher 2
Yeah.
 Sprecher 2


 Sprecher 2
Maybe a couple of weeks, couple of months and then yeah.
 Sprecher 2
Finally, I would do it, but.
 Sprecher 2
With them dating him, I don't know about it.
 Sprecher 1
It takes in would be.
 Sprecher 1


 Sprecher 1
Takes in would be.
 Sprecher 1
Reluctance.
 Sprecher 2
Yeah.
 Sprecher 1
I like transportation scene isn't is a lot is much better word.
 Sprecher 1
There's been an anti sin.
 Sprecher 1
Now come.
 Sprecher 1
Let's move onto.
 Sprecher 1
Yeah, maybe a a a subject which you haven't really thought of before.
 Sprecher 1
What are you fuse on?
 Sprecher 1
Using a swap feeds which has possibly been used before by someone else that you don't know.
 Sprecher 2
Oh I, I really don't mind.
 Sprecher 2
Couldn't care less.
 Sprecher 1
Do you have any Association with with the bike being dirty or contaminated or something?
 Sprecher 2
No.
 Sprecher 2
Do you believe that the more ugly the bike is less likely to get stone, and so it doesn't really matter.
 Sprecher 1
OK.
 Sprecher 1
All right?
 Sprecher 3
And then on the scale on one to five, how contaminated do you think that's what people will be?
 Sprecher 3
So 5 is really contaminated and one is not contaminated at all.
 Sprecher 2
I think one or two because they always look very clean.
 Sprecher 1
Where and where would you where?
 Sprecher 2
Religious.
 Sprecher 1
Would you then put a second hand bike?
 Sprecher 1
Yeah, when that you would get in a bike shop in the in the center of Utah for example.
 Sprecher 2
Ann
 Sprecher 2
About a four
 Sprecher 1
So I said.
 Sprecher 2
If a 5 is on the mark that.
 Sprecher 2
Or thoughts?
 Sprecher 2


 Sprecher 1
If it is so for the bike you the bike you buy from a shady dealer in the middle of the night, that's all the way at the top, yeah.
 Sprecher 2
Yeah, yeah.
 Sprecher 2
Yeah.
 Sprecher 1
So, but so swap you would.
 Sprecher 1
Yeah.
 Sprecher 1
Yeah, would you say that's what feature generat?
 Sprecher 1
Generally clean then?
 Sprecher 2
Yeah, definitely.
 Sprecher 1
OK.
 Sprecher 1
Uhm, Anne, could you tell me to what extent do you think that's what feeds does or does not fit your lifestyle?
 Sprecher 1
Me.
 Sprecher 1


 Sprecher 2
Ann
 Sprecher 2
On a scale, right?
 Sprecher 1
And like, do you think that you would have to adjust your normal lifestyle if you were to swift swap feeds?
 Sprecher 2
No.
 Sprecher 1
Ann
 Sprecher 2
I don't see why.
 Sprecher 3
Do you have like any stereotypes associated with swap feats, and if so, could you elaborate?
 Sprecher 2
No, I think they're pretty bikes, and I think half of you dressed owns one.
 Sprecher 2
Mostly students I think.
 Sprecher 2
I think it's a student bike.
 Sprecher 1
Yeah, so like the average swap feats would just have a student sitting on it and what?
 Sprecher 2
Yeah, yeah.
 Sprecher 1
What would that?
 Sprecher 1
What would that student look like if you were to paint a picture?
 Sprecher 2
Oh
 Sprecher 2
OK.
 Sprecher 2
Are you familiar with the ECS fee?
 Sprecher 1
I am yeah no yeah.
 Sprecher 2
If yes.
 Sprecher 2
Yeah, I don't know.
 Sprecher 2
Yeah.
 Sprecher 2


 Sprecher 2
I see OK flare.
 Sprecher 2
It says the US flag or oh sure so kinda I don't know.
 Sprecher 2
I like the more elites kind of people to say sorry.
 Sprecher 1
Yeah.
 Sprecher 2
I don't think.
 Sprecher 2
Poor people are poor looking people so.
 Sprecher 1
But but
 Sprecher 2
How to say it properly but?
 Sprecher 1
And even.
 Sprecher 3
So, so I think that's what feeds would be more for people with more money, yeah?
 Sprecher 2
Yeah for sure.
 Sprecher 1
An elite product for those lucky few who can share a bike with a blue tire.
 Sprecher 2
Yeah.
 Sprecher 3
Yeah.
 Sprecher 1
Is it?
 Sprecher 1
Yeah, so.
 Sprecher 1
So what kind of lifestyle do you think that's what feeds then stands for?
 Sprecher 2
Whoo.
 Sprecher 2
I know just only have in my mind to go to uni with.
 Sprecher 2
I don't know because I think about students now only I go through the hockey club.
 Sprecher 3
Just.
 Sprecher 1
OK.
 Sprecher 3
So just like the student lifestyle for younger people.
 Sprecher 2
Yeah yeah yeah OK.
 Sprecher 2
Yeah yeah, OK.
 Sprecher 1
Yeah, and would you see the.
 Sprecher 1
Which you could you envision like older people also using swap feats.
 Sprecher 2
Maybe they could, but I never see them.
 Sprecher 2
Actually on it.
 Sprecher 1
OK.
 Sprecher 1
And why?
 Sprecher 1
And if you could guess, why do you think that is?
 Sprecher 2
Maybe I do not know what it is or.
 Sprecher 2
They I also think that the generation from our parents.
 Sprecher 2
They really believe in investing in one good quality bike that costs about €2000 sometimes.
 Sprecher 2
Instead of our generation, which uses a bike to go out and to leave it on the station and care less.
 Sprecher 2
It's about their bikes.
 Sprecher 2


 Sprecher 2
About that but.
 Sprecher 2


 Sprecher 2
About their bikes.
 Sprecher 2
I think that also plays a role.
 Sprecher 2
Why I only see students with these bikes OK?
 Sprecher 1
OK.
 Sprecher 1


 Sprecher 1
So then how do you feel about this subscription model swap feats rather than buying a bicycle, be it secondhand or first hand?
 Sprecher 2
I I think.
 Sprecher 2
It is good because they are.
 Sprecher 2
Her and they were Paris, but.
 Sprecher 2
Yeah, I don't really see a need for it.
 Sprecher 1
And why do you?
 Sprecher 2
First with him.
 Sprecher 1
And why do you then choose not to participate in such a model?
 Sprecher 1
'cause you mentioned a couple of times.
 Sprecher 1
That you found it expensive.
 Sprecher 2
Yeah, yeah.
 Sprecher 2
I have my bike since and group seven since I was 10, so I still have the same bike.
 Sprecher 2
Through it
 Sprecher 2


 Sprecher 2
Yeah, and it never got stolen.
 Sprecher 2
Yes.
 Sprecher 2


 Sprecher 2
Never anything is broken so I don't have many experiences with paying regularly from my bike at all.
 Sprecher 2
So I don't see why you should pay you, so here is a month for a bike.
 Sprecher 3
And do you feel that also some sort of like attachments?
 Sprecher 3
Your own right?
 Sprecher 2
This mine maybe a little because I just had it for so long and it was a gift from my parents and all the memories.
 Sprecher 2
Maybe I do.
 Sprecher 3
Yeah, yeah, I know that bike, yeah?
 Sprecher 1
Ah.
 Sprecher 3
So if your friends and family would suddenly start using swap feeds, which would then be more inclined to also use it, and did you rolled by?
 Sprecher 2
I didn't think I would ditch my old bike, but I do think if it were to be stolen or anything that I might try it.
 Sprecher 3
OK.
 Sprecher 1
This yeah, do you think that's what feeds which is presenting a good monetary deal like?
 Sprecher 1
Yeah.
 Sprecher 1
Would it be a good deal to get?
 Sprecher 1
A swap feats money wise.
 Sprecher 2
No, I don't think so.
 Sprecher 1
Whynott
 Sprecher 2
I think if you have it for a couple of years that it will cost you hundreds.
 Sprecher 2
More dollars but euros.
 Sprecher 2
Uh, and yeah, I think also a bike.
 Sprecher 2
From €100 would be fine as well. I don't know about the quality of the swap face to be honest. There maybe their quality is really outstanding, so I don't really have anything to compare it with.
 Sprecher 2
And again, I don't think it's a good deal.
 Sprecher 1
And say because we talked about the hypothetical situation that your bike broke down.
 Sprecher 1
Say that a couple of years in the future you have a precisely sizable amount of money to spend and you are looking for a new bike.
 Sprecher 1
And there's this lovely.
 Sprecher 1
Top Model from Giselle is or gazelle.
 Sprecher 1
One of them is a bike brand, I think, but it's it's.
 Sprecher 1
But it costs 8 or €900 with that then.
 Sprecher 1
Between that and swap feats, which would have your preference.
 Sprecher 4
Oh


Boo.
 Sprecher 2
Yeah, then I would go for a small piece maybe yeah?
 Sprecher 2
Because if you would buy a Ferris hand actual good like it calls you a lot.
 Sprecher 2
So then I think swap.
 Sprecher 2
Please would be the better option.
 Sprecher 2
Better deal.
 Sprecher 1
OK.
 Sprecher 1
OK.
 Sprecher 3
And also another question about the surface, imagining that you lose your bike or damage it.
 Sprecher 3
To what extent do you trust shop reach the surface that would supply you with a good replacement?
 Sprecher 3
In time, sorry that it would supply you with a replacement in time you trust them.


Yeah.
 Sprecher 3
OK.
 Sprecher 1
How, how long do you think it would take for your bike to get replaced for your broken bike to get replaced?
 Sprecher 2
I, I think if you would go to the shop and point out that something had broken, you would get a new one immediately.
 Sprecher 2
I don't know if that's true.
 Sprecher 2
But that's just what I expect.
 Sprecher 1
Easy peasy.
 Sprecher 2
Yep.
 Sprecher 3
Oh yeah, I think we had all the questions.
 Sprecher 1
Yeah, is there anything you would like to add still that we maybe did not discuss?
 Sprecher 2
Ann
 Sprecher 2
Yeah, maybe because an if I said at first I thought it was maybe contradicting myself a little bit, but when I say that I don't think it's a good deal, I'm referring it to swap feeds comparative.
 Sprecher 2
I.
 Sprecher 2


 Sprecher 2
A bike you get from the city centre of 100 years or something and not like the good quality bike you mentioned.
 Sprecher 2
As I think that's good to see.
 Sprecher 1
Yeah, yeah, so that is yeah.
 Sprecher 1
So you feel like it's.
 Sprecher 2
Yeah, maybe in a couple of years I will be more going towards a good quality bike of hundreds of thousands euros, but I really yeah wouldn't spend more to 100 years and like.
 Sprecher 1
Right?
 Sprecher 1
Yeah.
 Sprecher 1


 Sprecher 1
But but in a couple of years, you wouldn't be a student anymore as well.
 Sprecher 2
No, that's true.
 Sprecher 1
So that so, would you not feel awkward riding on a bike, riding on a swap?
 Sprecher 1
Feet through town?
 Sprecher 3
I.
 Sprecher 2
I think that it will grow in an.
 Sprecher 2
That is so set in our lifestyle and generation that it also continues when we are 30 or whatever.
 Sprecher 2
Do we still have the swap bikes?
 Sprecher 2
And they wouldn't be only for students anymore, I think.
 Sprecher 1
OK.
 Sprecher 1
Alright, yeah, now I think I think that will provide us with a lot of good insights.
 Sprecher 2
OK, good.
 Sprecher 1
So.
 Sprecher 1
Yeah, scrolling through this.
 Sprecher 1
Things no.
 Sprecher 1
Thank you for your for your time listener.
 Sprecher 1
We really appreciate it and for all your lovely answers and your lovely stories.
 Sprecher 2
Thank you, no problem.
 Sprecher 1
Could we contact you if we perhaps need some clarifications on your answers?


Not sure all right.
 Sprecher 1
Right?
 Sprecher 1


 Sprecher 1
Well, on that bombshell I suppose we're done for today, so thank you.
 Sprecher 3
OK thanks Jason.

 Sprecher 1
Infinite caps.
 Sprecher 1
So far getting into filtering different.


Ah.
 Sprecher 3
Yeah, that's true, yeah?
 Sprecher 1
Yeah yeah, yeah.
 Sprecher 1


 Sprecher 1
Yeah, yeah.
 Sprecher 1
That's that's extra skill.
 Sprecher 2
My.
 Sprecher 1
Even Steven.
 Sprecher 1
Yeah, nay, that you don't need person who solved pragmatic one.
 Sprecher 1
Matthews marking Suzanne.
 Sprecher 1
That's not fair to her brother.

We had some trouble asking the right questions and asking for elaboration without steering the conversation too much.
 Sprecher 4
Uh huh.

But there were some.
 Sprecher 1
There were some interesting stories.
 Sprecher 4
OK, nice.

And it definitely went, went OK.
 Sprecher 4
That's good, I'm also just I was just briefly recording this because I wanted to make absolutely sure that it works.

Yeah, like listen back to your audio to make sure that there's no echo.
 Sprecher 4
Ann
 Sprecher 1

Wait a second.

 Sprecher 1
This is what will codify the interview and then, well.
 Sprecher 2
Yeah.
 Sprecher 3
Thanks.
 Sprecher 1
Well, we'll see.
 Sprecher 1
Yeah.
 Sprecher 1
Now it's interesting.
 Sprecher 1
The fact that I mean the fact that there's like a view on the people who use swap feats and because she was talking about.
 Sprecher 1
Our parents generation not like opposing the subscription model because they're like you gotta invest in a proper bike and stuff and she.
 Sprecher 1
Like
 Sprecher 1


 Sprecher 1
He
 Sprecher 1
It felt like she sort of kind of shared like a rudimentary.
 Sprecher 1
Part of that view when she said that swap fees is too expensive compared to secondhand bike, so I'll buy a secondhand bike, but when it comes to like a bigger first grade high grade bike of a couple €100, which is not.
 Sprecher 1
Which is relatively averagely priced I think then.
 Sprecher 1
Swap feats would get would get the preference.
 Sprecher 4
Me.
 Sprecher 1
Because then it would be cheaper.
 Sprecher 4
Interesting, yeah.
 Sprecher 4
On the other hand, if you buy a new bike, it usually lasts longer than your second hand bike, so that's maybe a comparison.
 Sprecher 4
You can't really make.
 Sprecher 1
I yeah.
 Sprecher 1
Interesting interesting cool.
 Sprecher 1
I am going to leave the call.
 Sprecher 1
I'm going to stop the recording as well.
 Sprecher 4
