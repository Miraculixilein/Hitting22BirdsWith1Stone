OK.
 Sprecher 2
hey
 Sprecher 1
net optijd
 Sprecher 3
hey lisanne
 Sprecher 1
Who yeah?
 Sprecher 2
hoi
 Sprecher 1
Ik ben Emiel, ik ben studiegenootje van Fleur, ik denk dat jij Fleur ook kent he
 Sprecher 2
ja, een beetje
 Sprecher 1
mooi
 Sprecher 1
We zouden het interview in het Engels doen
 Sprecher 2
Yep.
 Sprecher 1
Yeah, yeah, on that bombshell.
 Sprecher 1
Fleur wil jij hem overnemen?

Sprecher 3
Oh yes, so first we would like to have a general introduction of yourself.
 Sprecher 3
So OK, tell me your name, how old you are and what your general occupation is.
 Sprecher 2
My name is Lisane, I'm 23 years old and I  Am a student.

I am working on an internship right now Amsterdam
 Sprecher 1
What do you study? 
 Sprecher 2
Yeah, I just finished my bachelors and I'm going to start my Masters in September, but now I have a voluntary internship.
 Sprecher 1
And a Bachelor in  what?
 Sprecher 2
Biology
 Sprecher 1
Biology.
 Sprecher 3
Yeah, so a little bit about why we do the interview, so we're following of course research methods and we have to write a paper about the sharing economy and we chose to write something about non-adoption.
 Sprecher 3
of the sharing economy.
 Sprecher 3
An in this case
 Sprecher 3
the swapfiets and yeah.
 Sprecher 3
So since you are not adopter of Swap fiets we would like to get your views on it and why you didn't adopt it.
 Sprecher 3
So we have a set of questions for you.
 Sprecher 3
So let's start
 Sprecher 3
But what are your biking habits and what do you think of swap fiets
 Sprecher 2
Uh, my biking habits ..  I used to bike to uni everyday but now.
 Sprecher 2
In the Corona times, I don't have to anymore.
 Sprecher 2
I.
 Sprecher 2
uh
 Sprecher 2
i used to do City Bike ride, about 20-30 minutes.
 Sprecher 2
As I use it quite often, I also use it to go to my sports.
 Sprecher 2
Which is 20 minute bike ride, and now also to go to do grocery shopping, and what was the other question again? I'm sorry.
 Sprecher 3
And what do you think about swap fiets, uh.
 Sprecher 2
I I think it's very nice for general people,  I think my own bike is..I've had it for a couple of years now and it just works fine, so that's why I don't really use it but I do know quite a lot of people who do use it.
 Sprecher 2
I believe it is quite expensive. I thought it was about €12.00 per month. I could be wrong but.
 Sprecher 2
I think.. I think that is quite expensive, and but the bikes are really nice, and so even though you know a lot of people that are owner swap fiets, you still have your own bike.
 Sprecher 3
So do you have some kind of feeling tired towards tourist bike ownership?
 Sprecher 3
Like do you attached to your own bike?
 Sprecher 3
Do you think it's important?
 Sprecher 3
To have your own bike?
 Sprecher 2
uhm
 Sprecher 2
No, I don't think so.
 Sprecher 2
I think it could be nice to rent a bike because then you also have the additional… How you call it?
 Sprecher 2
Like when your lamp is broken, they automatically fix it.
 Sprecher 2
Instead of,  you have a guarantee to do it yourself.
 Sprecher 2
Yeah, exactly, and with your own bike you just have to pay for it yourself, so I think it's not really better to have your own bike.
 Sprecher 3
OK.
 Sprecher 3
uhm
 Sprecher 3
And do you think then, that the service of swap fiets would outperform or underperform?
 Sprecher 3
Like a regular repair service.
 Sprecher 2
Uhm?
 Sprecher 2
Yeah, that's a tough question because you do have to pay for it, kinda.
 Sprecher 2
But also not so I think if they would lower it to about 10 euro’s a month instead of 12, which I think it is.
 Sprecher 2
Then I think it would outperform regular services.
 Sprecher 2
So it really depends for me, at least at the price.
 Sprecher 3
And also the repair, do you think it would be better with swap fiets than a regular bike repair shop for example?
 Sprecher 2
Not necessarily, but I do have kind of a belief that regular shops do not fix your bike's as properly as they have to  because they want you to come back. I don't know if that's true, but I just have a feeling about it.
 Sprecher 1
Huh?
 Sprecher 2
It always breaks a couple of days later, again at the same place or whatever, so I didn't think that their repair would be better, yeah.
 Sprecher 1
Interesting.
 Sprecher 1
So with that in mind, do you think that swap fiets  would then provide you with a  good, safe, sturdier product, better than like the average bike?
 Sprecher 2
Yes, yes.
 Sprecher 3
Oh
 Sprecher 3
OK.
 Sprecher 1
suppose your bike would breakdown now, would you consider getting a swap fiets?
 Sprecher 3
uhm
 Sprecher 2
Yeah, I, I think so for a couple of months maybe.
 Sprecher 2
Uh, but, eventually, I think the price outweighs  it.
 Sprecher 2
If you pay for a bike at once, maybe to overlap sometime.
 Sprecher 3
OK, then you just stated like a con of the swap fiets.
 Sprecher 3
What are according to you the pros and cons of adopting a swap fiets?
 Sprecher 2
Uhm?
 Sprecher 2
Cons , I think the price again uhm
 Sprecher 2
Pros uhm.. You will get a new bike.
 Sprecher 2
I think if yours was stolen and you don't have to pay as much for the old bike, I think it was like that but I think you had to pay some kind of amount of about €50 if you have a double lock on it. And €100 or something if you don't have a double lock on it,



 Sprecher 2
 you're correct.
 Sprecher 2
So I think that's both pro and Con because you do have to pay it.
 Sprecher 2
True.
 Sprecher 2
Even though you can buy a bike 100 years for yourself and the pro that you automatically get a new one instead of searching for another and the repairs, I think.
 Sprecher 2
Would be better for the swap fiets
 
 Sprecher 1
Yeah.
 Sprecher 1
Hey.
 Sprecher 3
OK.
 Sprecher 1
With the.. Given that they repair your bike a lot or well that they repair your bike, that that is included in the service, would you feel more responsible using the bike or like tell me about how responsible you would feel for a leased bike like swap fiets compared to a bike that you own?
 Sprecher 2
I think I will feel less responsible with the swap bike.
 Sprecher 2
I think mainly because you have to pay for yourself with your own bike. And I'm student, So..
 Sprecher 1
So you say you wouldn't mind just like biking, a little edgier, crashing into walls, or.
 Sprecher 1
But like where? Where would you draw the line in that in that regard?


 Sprecher 3
Uh.
 Sprecher 2
I don't think I really uhm.. like Crashing my bike, but I don't know actually, because also that the fact that you have to pay extra if your bike gets stolen  and then you would always double lucky and I never do with my own bike, so maybe I'm not that cautious with my own bike
 Sprecher 1
Yeah.
 Sprecher 2
Actually I think I would be more cautious with a  swap fiets
 Sprecher 1
Really, and why?
 Sprecher 2
Yeah.
 Sprecher 4
Yeah.
 Sprecher 3
Yeah.
 Sprecher 3

 Sprecher 2
Because of the extra, money you have to pay them.
 Sprecher 1
That's it.
 Sprecher 3
For the repairs.
 Sprecher 2
I don't know.
 Sprecher 2
I don't think you can do anything to prevent your bike really  from getting some regular damage.
 Sprecher 1
And then, and is it really then a matter of that you pay for this service or that it costs extra?
 Sprecher 1
Or is it?
 Sprecher 1
Does it also have to do with the fact that there's a company behind it, or that the bike might be used by other people or?
 Sprecher 1
uhm
 Sprecher 2
just the cost.
 Sprecher 1
Just the cost, all right?
 Sprecher 3
And like how do you feel? uh, because swap fiets really urges their users to double lock their bites, 
and how do you feel about the company telling you what to do?
 Sprecher 1
Uh.
 Sprecher 2
Yeah, I I don't really mind.
 Sprecher 1
You think it's a you think it's it's, It's a redelijke..
 Sprecher 2
I don't think it's necessary.
 Sprecher 2
Yeah, and I also don't think it's necessary to explicitly say that you have to double lock your bike, 'cause if they do have that extra fee then I think you would automatically double lock it.
 Sprecher 1
OK.
 Sprecher 1
Interesting.
 Sprecher 2
So.
 Sprecher 1
Fleur
 Sprecher 3
Oh, would you feel guilty if you would damage the bike or lose the bike and why?
 Sprecher 3
And also in comparison to your own bike.
 Sprecher 3
uh, I think with a swap fiets I would be more feeling guilty and with my own bike more angry at myself I think.
 Sprecher 3
Yeah, I don't know.
 Sprecher 2
And why?
 Sprecher 2
The guilty also , guilty towards myself.
 Sprecher 2
Instead of towards the company.
 Sprecher 2
The guilt feeling of losing that extra money
 Sprecher 2
Yeah, OK.
 Sprecher 2
But nothing towards the company 
 Sprecher 1
Yeah, OK, so so so it's yeah so it it yeah no that then then I'm filling in for you for you.. that you feel guilty for for the service but only because this now cost.. you cost you extra money yeah.
 Sprecher 1
Hey.
 
 Sprecher 2
Yeah.
 Sprecher 1
Yeah.
 Sprecher 3
Oh so yeah, maybe we can touch a bit on the complexity of swap fiets.. so can you tell me a bit about how complicated it would be to get a swap fiets?
 Sprecher 2
Uh.
 Sprecher 1
How complicated do you think it would be?
 Sprecher 2
I didn't think it would be kinda complicated.
 Sprecher 2
I never really looked into it, but I think they have a decent website where you can, ..I don't know,  Call them or make a reservation online.
 Sprecher 2
I don't know, I'm not sure and I do believe also that they have shops, but I don't know where to find them.
 Sprecher 3
Yes, they have shops.
 Sprecher 2
That's probably ...yeah.
 Sprecher 2
I think the same with renting a bike on a holiday.
 Sprecher 2
Just walk in and get it, yeah?
 Sprecher 1
Easy peasy, no problem.
 Sprecher 1
Yeah.
 Sprecher 3
And what about the registration process?
 Sprecher 3
Do you think that would be complicated?
 Sprecher 1
I think it would take a long time.

 Sprecher 2
I no .. I don't think so.
 Sprecher 1
That is an answer.
 Sprecher 1
That's very much,  a very useful answer.
 Sprecher 1
Because it it, yeah.
 Sprecher 1
You definitely see swap fiets  as something easy to get.
 Sprecher 1
uh
 Sprecher 2
Yeah.
 Sprecher 1
Also, would you call it a  quick fix?
 Sprecher 1
Almost.
 Sprecher 2
Yeah, definitely.
 Sprecher 1
OK.
 Sprecher 2
I'm actually more worried with these kind of things that you get monthly, that ending such a subscription is more difficult than starting one.
 Sprecher 1
And how so?
 Sprecher 2
It's always kind of awkward, I think, to call them or go to them, to explain yourself why you want to stop, or sometimes I think.
 Sprecher 2
Companies also make it difficult for you, Because they keep pushing you to continue, but I do not really expect that from them.
 Sprecher 1
So will that have to do with the fact that you're… They want you to keep the swap  fiets
 Sprecher 2
Yes.
 Sprecher 1
Yeah.
 Sprecher 1
OK.
 Sprecher 1
So how would you feel if you say you have a swap fiets subscription, and you decide that it's getting too expensive or you want a regular bike.
 Sprecher 1
And how would you feel calling them up or doing it online and having to tell them that you no longer are in need of their service?
 Sprecher 1
Yes.
 Sprecher 1

 Sprecher 2
Yeah, I think I would procrastinate it.
 Sprecher 2
Yeah.
 Sprecher 2
Maybe a couple of weeks, couple of months and then yeah.
 Sprecher 2
Finally, I would do it, but, with tegenzin.. I don't the word about it.
 Sprecher 1
tegenzin would be….
 Sprecher 1
Tegenzin  would be reluctance.
 Sprecher 2
Yeah.
 Sprecher 1
But tegenzin  is a much better word.
 Sprecher 1
There's been an tegenzin
 Sprecher 1
Now come.
 Sprecher 1
Let's move onto… Yeah, maybe  a subject which you haven't really thought of before.
 Sprecher 1
What are you views on using a swap fiets which has possibly been used before by someone else that you don't know.
 Sprecher 2
Oh I, I really don't mind.
 Sprecher 2
Couldn't care less.
 Sprecher 1
Do you have any Association with with the bike being dirty or contaminated or something?
 Sprecher 2
No.
 Sprecher 2
I believe that the more ugly the bike is less likely to get stolen, and so it doesn't really matter.
 Sprecher 1
OK.
 Sprecher 1
All right?
 Sprecher 3
And then on the scale of one to five, how contaminated do you think that's swap fiets  would be?
 Sprecher 3
So 5 is really contaminated and one is not contaminated at all.
 Sprecher 2
I think one or two because they always look very clean.
 Sprecher 1
And where would you then put a second hand bike?
 Sprecher 1
Yeah, when that you would get in a bike shop in the in the center of Utrecht for example.
 Sprecher 2
uhm
 Sprecher 2
About a four
 Sprecher 1
So I said.
 Sprecher 2
If a 5 is on the marktplaats
sprecher 1
If it is so for the bike , you buy from a shady dealer in the middle of the night, that's all the way at the top, yeah.
 Sprecher 2
Yeah, yeah.
 Sprecher 2
Yeah.
 Sprecher 1
So, but so swap you would.
 Sprecher 1
Yeah.
 Sprecher 1
Yeah, would you say that's swap fiets are  generally, generally clean then?
 Sprecher 2
Yeah, definitely.
 Sprecher 1
OK.
 Sprecher 1
Uhm, And, could you tell me to what extent do you think that's swap fiets does or does not fit your lifestyle?
 Sprecher 1
me

 Sprecher 2
uh
 Sprecher 2
On a scale, right?
 Sprecher 1
And like, do you think that you would have to adjust your normal lifestyle if you were to switch to swap fiets
 Sprecher 2
No.
 Sprecher 1
uh
 Sprecher 2
I don't see why.
 Sprecher 3
Do you have like any stereotypes associated with swap fiets, and if so, could you elaborate?
 Sprecher 2
No, I think they're pretty bikes, and I think half of Utrecht owns one.
 Sprecher 2
Mostly students I think.
 Sprecher 2
I think it's a student bike.
 Sprecher 1
Yeah, so like the average swap fiets would just have a student sitting on it and what?
 Sprecher 2
Yeah, yeah.
 Sprecher 1
What would that?
 Sprecher 1
What would that student look like if you were to paint a picture?
 Sprecher 2
Oh
 Sprecher 2
OK.
 Sprecher 2
Are you familiar with the  UVSV ?
 Sprecher 1
I am yeah no yeah.
 Sprecher 2
uvjes
 Sprecher 2
Yeah, I don't know.
 Sprecher 2
Yeah.
 Sprecher 2

 Sprecher 2
I see, OK fleur
 Sprecher 2
It says the vrouwenkoor or oh sure so kinda I don't know,  like the more elites kind of people to say so.
 Sprecher 1
Yeah.
 Sprecher 2
I don't think Poor people or poor looking people do so,  But but How to say it properly but?
 Sprecher 1
hahah
 Sprecher 3
So, so you think that's swap fiets would be more for people with more money, yeah?
 Sprecher 2
Yeah for sure.
 Sprecher 1
An elite product for those lucky few who can share a bike with a blue tire.
 Sprecher 2
Yeah.
 Sprecher 3
Yeah.
 Sprecher 1
Is it?
 Sprecher 1
Yeah, so.
 Sprecher 1
So what kind of lifestyle do you think that's swap fiets then stands for?
 Sprecher 2
Whoo.
 Sprecher 2
I know just only have in my mind to go to uni with.
 Sprecher 2
I don't know because I think about students now only I go to the hockey club.
 Sprecher 3
Just.
 Sprecher 1
OK.
 Sprecher 3
So just like the student lifestyle for younger people.
 Sprecher 2
Yeah yeah yeah OK.
 Sprecher 2
Yeah yeah, OK.
 Sprecher 1
Yeah, and would you see the.
 Sprecher 1
could you envision like older people also using swap fiets.
 Sprecher 2
Maybe they could, but I never see them, actually on it.
 Sprecher 1
OK.
 Sprecher 1
And why?
 Sprecher 1
And if you could guess, why do you think that is?
 Sprecher 2
Maybe I do not know what it is or they.. I also think that the generation from our parents.. They really believe in investing in one good quality bike that costs about €2000 sometimes.. Instead of our generation, which uses a bike to go out and to leave it on the station and care less about their bikes. I think that also plays a role.
 Sprecher 2
Why I only see students with these bikes 
 Sprecher 1
OK.
  Sprecher 1
So then how do you feel about this subscription model swap fiets rather than buying a bicycle, be it secondhand or first hand?
 Sprecher 2
I I think.
 Sprecher 2
It is good because they offer the repairs
 Sprecher 2
Yeah, I don't really see a need for it.
 Sprecher 1
And why do you then choose not to participate in such a model? ..'cause you mentioned a couple of times that you found it expensive.
 Sprecher 2
Yeah, yeah.
 Sprecher 2
I have my bike since and group seven since I was 10, so I still have the same bike.

Sprecher 2
Yeah, and it never got stolen.
 Sprecher 2
Yes.
 Sprecher 2
Never anything is broken so I don't have many experiences with paying regularly from my bike at all.
 Sprecher 2
So I don't see why you should pay you, so here is a month for a bike.
 Sprecher 3
And do you feel that also some sort of like , attachment to your own bike?
 Sprecher 2
With mine maybe a little because I just had it for so long and it was a gift from my parents and all the memories.
 Sprecher 2
Maybe I do.
 Sprecher 3
Yeah, yeah, I know that bike, 
 Sprecher 1
yeah
 Sprecher 3
So if your friends and family would suddenly start using swap fiets, which would then be more inclined to also use it, and ditch your old bike?
 Sprecher 2
I didn't think I would ditch my old bike, but I do think if it were to be stolen or anything that I might try it.
 Sprecher 3
OK.
 Sprecher 1
This yeah, do you think that's swap fiets which is presenting a good monetary deal like?
 Sprecher 1
Yeah.
 Sprecher 1
Would it be a good deal to get?
A swap fiets,  money wise.
 Sprecher 2
No, I don't think so.
 Sprecher 1
Why not?
 Sprecher 2
I think if you have it for a couple of years that it will cost you hundreds, more dollars uhh euros.
 Sprecher 2
Uh, and yeah, I think also a bike, from €100 would be fine as well. I don't know about the quality of the swap fiets to be honest. There maybe their quality is really outstanding, so I don't really have anything to compare it with.
 Sprecher 2
And again, I don't think it's a good deal.
 Sprecher 1
And say, because we talked about the hypothetical situation that your bike broke down.
 Sprecher 1
Say that a couple of years in the future you have a sizable amount of money to spend and you are looking for a new bike.. And there's this lovely, Top Model from Giselle is or gazelle.. One of them is a bike brand, I think, but it's it's. But it costs 8 or €900 ,could  that then Between that and swap fiets, which would have your preference.
 Sprecher 2
Yeah, then I would go for a swap fiets  maybe yeah?
 Sprecher 2
Because if you would buy a first hand  actual good like it costs  you a lot.
 Sprecher 2
So then I think swap  fiets would be the better option...
Better deal.
 Sprecher 1
OK.
 Sprecher 1
OK.
 Sprecher 3
And also another question about the service, imagining that you lose your bike or damage it.. To what extent do you trust swapfiets’ service that would supply you with a good replacement In time, sorry that it would supply you with a replacement in time , do you trust them?
Sprecher 2
Yeah.
 Sprecher 3
OK.
 Sprecher 1
How, how long do you think it would take for your bike to get replaced for your broken bike to get replaced?
 Sprecher 2
I, I think if you would go to the shop and point out that something had broken, you would get a new one immediately.
 Sprecher 2
I don't know if that's true.
 Sprecher 2
But that's just what I expect.
 Sprecher 1
Easy peasy.
 Sprecher 2
Yep.
 Sprecher 3
Oh yeah, I think we had all the questions.
 Sprecher 1
Yeah, is there anything you would like to add still that we maybe did not discuss?
 Sprecher 2
Ann
 Sprecher 2
Yeah, maybe because uh if I said at first I thought it was maybe contradicting myself a little bit, but when I say that I don't think it's a good deal, I'm referring it to swap fiets compared to
A bike you get from the city centre of 100 years or something and not like the good quality bike you mentioned.
 Sprecher 2
As I think that's good to say
 Sprecher 1
Yeah, yeah, so that is yeah.
 Sprecher 1
So you feel like it's.
 Sprecher 2
Yeah, maybe in a couple of years I will be more going towards a good quality bike of hundreds of thousands euros, but I really yeah wouldn't spend more to 100 years and like.
 Sprecher 1
Right?
 Sprecher 1
Yeah.
 Sprecher 1
But but in a couple of years, you wouldn't be a student anymore as well.
 Sprecher 2
No, that's true.
 Sprecher 1
So that so, would you not feel awkward riding on a bike, riding on a swap fiets through town?
 Sprecher 3
I.
 Sprecher 2
I think that it will grow in .
 Sprecher 2
That is so said in our lifestyle and generation that it also continues when we are 30 or whatever.
 Sprecher 2
Do we still have the swap bikes and they wouldn't be only for students anymore, I think.
 Sprecher 1
OK.
 Sprecher 1
Alright, yeah, now I think I think that will provide us with a lot of good insights.
 Sprecher 2
OK, good.
 Sprecher 1
So.
 Sprecher 1
Yeah, scrolling through the Things ..no.
 Sprecher 1
Thank you for your for your time Lisanne
 Sprecher 1
We really appreciate it and for all your lovely answers and your lovely stories.
 Sprecher 2
Thank you, no problem.
 Sprecher 1
Could we contact you if we perhaps need some clarifications on your answers?
Sprecher 2
yeah sure all right.
 Sprecher 1
Right?
 Sprecher 1

 Sprecher 1
Well, on that bombshell I suppose we're done for today, so thank you.

 Sprecher 4
How did it go?
 Sprecher 1
It went alright.
 Sprecher 1
We had some trouble asking the right questions and asking for elaboration without steering the conversation too much.
 Sprecher 4
Uh huh.
 Sprecher 1
And we're we're discussing Leesons fuse a little bit.
 Sprecher 1
And I find it very hard to draw the line where of what we think are her views and what actually are her views because.
 Sprecher 1
Yes.
 Sprecher 1
But there were some.
 Sprecher 1
There were some interesting stories.
 Sprecher 4
OK, nice.
 Sprecher 1
And it definitely went, went OK.
 Sprecher 4
That's good, I'm also just I was just briefly recording this because I wanted to make absolutely sure that it works.
 Sprecher 1
All right?
 Sprecher 1
Yeah, like listen back to your audio to make sure that there's no echo.
 Sprecher 4
Ann
 Sprecher 1
I have to put on headphones to make sure that these two channels stay separate because there's no echo reduction in the OH BS recording.
 Sprecher 4
Wait a second.
 Sprecher 4
Yeah oh wait, I need to quickly get out the call because teams is muting my other audio so I'll be back in a second.
 Sprecher 4
So.
 Sprecher 4

 Sprecher 4
Wait, did you?
 Sprecher 4
Did you also do the video, only the audio?
 Sprecher 1
I I didn't record the video, yeah?
 Sprecher 4
OK, alright so one second.
 Sprecher 1
I'm yeah I.
 Sprecher 1
I did.
 Sprecher 1
I ended up recording it as an MKV file, but yeah, the.
 Sprecher 4
And NKB.
 Sprecher 4
A movie.
 Sprecher 1
No, but she's Peppa MK CMP.
 Sprecher 1
M cafe but in in in regardless I've got tools they can just pull the audio off, so that won't be a problem.
 Sprecher 2
I mean OK.
 Sprecher 4
Thank you.
 Sprecher 4
OK, OK.
 Sprecher 4

 Sprecher 4
OK, I'll quickly check the audio and then I'll be back.
 Sprecher 1
Yeah.
 Sprecher 1
So Fleur did.
 Sprecher 1
We learn anything new?
 Sprecher 1
I think we did.
 Sprecher 3
Yeah, she had some answers that were surprising to me that I didn't really anticipate on, but I don't remember which ones actually.
 Sprecher 1
This is what will codify the interview and then, well.
 Sprecher 2
Yeah.
 Sprecher 3
Thanks.
 Sprecher 1
Well, we'll see.
 Sprecher 1
Yeah.
 Sprecher 1
Now it's interesting.
 Sprecher 1
The fact that I mean the fact that there's like a view on the people who use swap feats and because she was talking about.
 Sprecher 1
Our parents generation not like opposing the subscription model because they're like you gotta invest in a proper bike and stuff and she.
 Sprecher 1
Like
 Sprecher 1

 Sprecher 1
He
 Sprecher 1
It felt like she sort of kind of shared like a rudimentary.
 Sprecher 1
Part of that view when she said that swap fees is too expensive compared to secondhand bike, so I'll buy a secondhand bike, but when it comes to like a bigger first grade high grade bike of a couple €100, which is not.
 Sprecher 1
Which is relatively averagely priced I think then.
 Sprecher 1
Swap feats would get would get the preference.
 Sprecher 4
Me.
 Sprecher 1
Because then it would be cheaper.
 Sprecher 4
Interesting, yeah.
 Sprecher 4
On the other hand, if you buy a new bike, it usually lasts longer than your second hand bike, so that's maybe a comparison.
 Sprecher 4
You can't really make.
 Sprecher 1
I yeah.
 Sprecher 1
Interesting interesting cool.
 Sprecher 1
I am going to leave the call.
 Sprecher 1
I'm going to stop the recording as well.
 Sprecher 4
Oh yeah.
 Sprecher 4
Oh
 Sprecher 1
Yeah, flirty.
 Sprecher 1
Do you have any final remarks?
 Sprecher 1
No, no, then stop there.
