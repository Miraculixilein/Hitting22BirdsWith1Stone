Speaker 2
Yeah, and then we switch to English for the software and for the project.
 Speaker 2
So that you were able to watch the movie you already told me.
 Speaker 1
Mr.
 Speaker 2
But just to be sure.
 Speaker 1
Yes, I was able to watch the short movie about 12 feats.
 Speaker 2
Very nice, that's very good.
 Speaker 2
We also have some small background questions like your name, age and general occupation like student of your or your job.
 Speaker 2
Well.
 Speaker 1
My name is Stace. I am 21 years old and I'm currently studying electrical engineering working at mediamarkt so.
 Speaker 2
Yeah, student job.
 Speaker 2
Well, you already know a bit that we are doing some research into the non adoption of swap fits.
 Speaker 2
You know what's wrong pieces so this will go about swap feeds and your bike habits.
 Speaker 2
And so, how would you actually, yeah, say that that your bike habits are daily or weekly.
 Speaker 2
How do you use your bike?
 Speaker 2
Nowadays
 Speaker 1
It's a transportation device that I use for everything that's close enough for me to bike to.
 Speaker 1
So mainly things like to college to the store, to go to friends, and anything that is less than 15 minutes bike ride.
 Speaker 1
I will take my bike for that.
 Speaker 2
And what do you think of swap feeds and would you ever if you bike would breakdown?
 Speaker 2
Would you consider it for us?
 Speaker 2
Yeah, also replacement of your personal life.
 Speaker 1
I might consider it because it takes away all the hassle with owning your own bike.
 Speaker 1
They take away every issue that you might have and they fix that for you for a price.
 Speaker 1
If I would be working full time, I would probably consider this, but as a student I would never do this.
 Speaker 2
Yeah, do you have other thoughts about swap pitch in general, like in the brand and the surface?
 Speaker 1
I.
 Speaker 1
It has slowly become bigger in the Netherlands over the past years.
 Speaker 1
But there's not that many people that use it next to students who lose their bike or who don't use a bike that often.
 Speaker 1
They go to something like swap feats because it's easy and they don't have to buy their own bike.
 Speaker 2
Say yeah yeah yeah for sure.
 Speaker 2
Uhm so.
 Speaker 2
Can you say something about pros and cons that you have personally for subfields?
 Speaker 1
I guess the there's a lot of pros to it because they.
 Speaker 1
They will fix anything for you.
 Speaker 1
They all the surface is included with swap feats.
 Speaker 1
Are probably worth the money 'cause if you compare it to owning a bike yourself and having to fix that if there's something wrong with it then that extra price you pay for swap feeds you can get your money's worth.
 Speaker 1
Wait?
 Speaker 1
But if you are careful with your own bike, then.
 Speaker 1
Then a bike can last much longer and you won't have to actually use all those surfaces, so that way that's a big con of swap fits.


Yes.
 Speaker 1
If you are nice with your bike and you don't do anything wrong, it is probably not worth the money.
 Speaker 2
Yeah.
 Speaker 2
Miller
 Speaker 2
Yeah, because well, you have a personal bike.
 Speaker 2
Is it secondhand or you?
 Speaker 1
I own multiple bikes, and they're all secondhand.
 Speaker 2
Alright, and why did you choose that option then?
 Speaker 1
Because it was free.
 Speaker 3
Oh nice.
 Speaker 2
Yes.
 Speaker 2
All right well?
 Speaker 2
This this word the more general questions we have composed a list of a few barriers that.
 Speaker 2
That came from the literature.
 Speaker 2
There are seven barriers, so we will go into some of these and the first one is complexity.
 Speaker 1
Is this?
 Speaker 2
It's yeah, it's a bit of the the product and the service, like the registration process and how you would, how you view that.
 Speaker 2
So what do you think of the registration process or the whole process that?
 Speaker 2
Involve shop feeds and its maintenance and.
 Speaker 1
Well, they advertise it as very easy.
 Speaker 1
Very easy to use and nowadays as long as you have a major interface and your website easy and accessible to use, there's no real issue there.
 Speaker 4
So yeah.
 Speaker 2
And you are comfortable with using this kind of interface.
 Speaker 2
So how would you view that?
 Speaker 2
The steps, the things that you have to do?
 Speaker 1
I.
 Speaker 1
Yeah, I'm comparatively more used to the Internet than most people, so for me I'm very much used to even annoying interfaces or anything so I know my way around everything quite quickly and easily, so that would never be an issue for me.
 Speaker 2
Yeah.
 Speaker 2
Yeah, well very good.
 Speaker 2


 Speaker 2
I am a bit more about the the product and its performance an so on a scale to one to five or five is the highest.


But
 Speaker 2
To what extent do you think that swap feeds would provide you with a good, safe and sturdy product like the bike itself?
 Speaker 1
I.
 Speaker 1
The bike itself is quite high-quality.
 Speaker 1
I have to say, but it's also built in a way where it's easily repaired and.
 Speaker 1
It's also build in a way where the parts are easily replaced, which.
 Speaker 1
Might in a way make it a bit less safe, but I think that would still end up around a four out of five for myself if I was to really buy a bike, I would get a higher quality one.
 Speaker 1
Then the swap heads.


Yes.
 Speaker 2
Yeah, yeah.
 Speaker 3
And do you?
 Speaker 3
Think that the service will swap with outperform or underperform prices.
 Speaker 3
Cycles like in relation to the Microsoft products.
 Speaker 1
On
 Speaker 1
It highly depends where you live and how you use your bike, because there's so many factors in play there.


Yes.
 Speaker 1
If you live in Utrecht as a student.
 Speaker 1
An then if I buy an expensive bike, there's 100% chance that it's going to break or that something is going to be wrong with it. So then yeah, I would go for swap feeds anytime, but if you're living in a family neighborhood where you can put your bike like in the back garden where it's safe where it's not, it won't get wet.
 Speaker 1
Etc.
 Speaker 1
Then yeah, a personal bike would be a better fit.
 Speaker 3
Yeah, yeah, that makes sense.
 Speaker 4
Yeah.
 Speaker 4


 Speaker 3
And to what extent do you think that's what fits?
 Speaker 3
Fits your with your lifestyle?
 Speaker 1
Uhm?
 Speaker 1
My lifestyle was cheap an and there there's if I if I didn't have the bike I had right now an I might.
 Speaker 4
So.
 Speaker 1
I think about doing it.
 Speaker 1
But a lot of students being students, I have to pay for everything myself, so I'm going to weigh it up against buying a super cheap secondhand one, or buying it off a homeless guy.
 Speaker 1
For 10 bucks.
 Speaker 1
You know there's always other options which you can weigh it up against.
 Speaker 1
And I don't need a perfect bike my bike right now was super old from my grandpa.
 Speaker 1
It's falling apart, but I can bike on it.
 Speaker 1
So.
 Speaker 2
Yeah.


Yeah.
 Speaker 2
Uhm?
 Speaker 2
Do we want to go into the image barrier a bit more and lifestyle or should we finish reliability first?
 Speaker 2
Oh
 Speaker 3
Oh, let's see.
 Speaker 3
Yeah, we could go back to reliability and then.
 Speaker 3
Go to the compatibility barriers.
 Speaker 3
Yeah, so will return to the reliability.
 Speaker 3
But you talked about that.
 Speaker 3
You find you talked about that.
 Speaker 3
You actually think that's why people don't have a good quality bike.
 Speaker 3
Also, that is easy, repairable.
 Speaker 3
But how would you compare the swap faces repair service to like a regular repair service in a bike shop?
 Speaker 1
Well nowadays bike repair shops have turned into what it feels like to me most.
 Speaker 1
Shops where they sell bikes and repair them.
 Speaker 1
It does become quite expensive and not nearly not worth the money 'cause all they do is they try to replace the parts and try to get as much money out of you as possible, but with swap feats they do this for you.
 Speaker 1
And also, you're not paying an insane amount for it because it's all the same bike.
 Speaker 1
It's obviously way cheaper for them to do these services on its own.
 Speaker 4
So yeah, and I.
 Speaker 1
I mean, I do think people are going to care less about their bike because this service is there, but at the same time because they only have one bike, it's really cheap for them to fix them.
 Speaker 1
So it probably outweighs each other.


Yeah, yeah.
 Speaker 2
Yeah and well, they also supply people with replacements.
 Speaker 2
If it's too broken that they can fix it at your house or something so that you don't have to wait for times before it is.
 Speaker 2
The maintenance is done and stuff like that and.
 Speaker 2
Do you trust them?
 Speaker 2
Uh, have you heard anything or what is your view on this replacement?
 Speaker 2
An subsided over?
 Speaker 1
I have not heard anything about it, but I would it it depends on how long the services take.
 Speaker 1
So like if you're at home and you've notice to.
 Speaker 1
I got a flat tire and you can just message them and like in three hours time they will come by and fix it for you.
 Speaker 1
That would be super chill.
 Speaker 1
But if it's like you're on your way to work, you got a flat tire.
 Speaker 1
They're obviously not going to be in time to fix your tire, so at that moment then it's like useless.
 Speaker 2
Yeah.
 Speaker 2
No, that always *****
 Speaker 1
Yeah Dad, every time.


Yeah.
 Speaker 2
Yeah, so some things they can't fix, of course, but the idea that you don't have to go to a repair shop.
 Speaker 1
Yeah, yeah.
 Speaker 1
And the prices for even fixing a flat tire repair shop are so insane that in I mean getting a like a a tire repair kit is half the price of getting your bike tire Patch to the repair shop.
 Speaker 1
It doesn't make any sense, yeah?


Yeah.




 Speaker 2
Yeah, so you feel that that service is also actually not that good.
 Speaker 2
Or not.
 Speaker 1
Yeah, yeah, there it's not worth the money for the amount of time they put into it. 'cause I can fix my tire in five minutes myself. Why is he charging me? €50 for it.
 Speaker 4
Yeah.
 Speaker 2
All right, I think that's that's clear about the reliability.
 Speaker 2
Next thing smaller.
 Speaker 2
Barrier is contamination.
 Speaker 2
You already talked that you have second hand bikes.
 Speaker 2
So what are your views on using a swap feature which is possibly possibly being used before?
 Speaker 2
By someone else.
 Speaker 1
I mean, I really wouldn't care about.
 Speaker 1
It I mean I.
 Speaker 1
Me myself, I wouldn't care, but it also depends on the price.
 Speaker 1
Depends.
 Speaker 1


 Speaker 1
Of course, if you are really paying a premium for it, then you would also expect a premium for the bike, but every time you get a swap feeds it is in high quality, good condition.
 Speaker 1
So who cares that it's being used before?


Right?
 Speaker 2
OK, very good.
 Speaker 2
Yeah.
 Speaker 2
Then a bit more about contamination on a scale from one to five.
 Speaker 2
How containment do you think this office would be?
 Speaker 2
Where five is the highest level of contamination and one is not containment at all?
 Speaker 2
Do what?
 Speaker 2
What are your feelings towards second hand?
 Speaker 1
And highly depends on what state the bike is in.
 Speaker 1
If there is very noticeable wear and tear on the bike that you will be like, OK, well this is like a four out of five three.
 Speaker 1
I mean if the bike is broken then it's going to be 5 out of five.
 Speaker 1
If the bike has noticeable wear and tear if it's bend or anything that would be like a three or four out of five.
 Speaker 1
But if it just looks relatively new with a few scratches, that's fine.
 Speaker 1
That's like a two out of five.
 Speaker 1
Well, that's always acceptable.
 Speaker 2
All right, very good.
 Speaker 2
Uhm, so responsibility is something else that we want to look into, like how responsible you feel for something that you don't do not own in comparison to your private bike.
 Speaker 2
What would you say about that?
 Speaker 1
In Trump beats does.
 Speaker 1
Repair the bike and replace the bike for you, right?
 Speaker 1
If you break it.
 Speaker 1
So in that aspect, I think a lot of people would have feel less responsibility because it's not theirs.
 Speaker 1
They can break it and they can get it freely replaced, while while if it's your own bike you have to get it fixed.
 Speaker 1
It's crazy expensive.
 Speaker 1
So obviously I think that if you're renting a bike, you're going to care less about the condition of it, but that's also it depends per person.
 Speaker 1
Of course, some people are very careful with their bikes, even if it's not their own.
 Speaker 3
Yeah.
 Speaker 2
Yeah.
 Speaker 2


 Speaker 3
Yeah, that's true.
 Speaker 3
And, well, swap feeds us actually have some rules when it comes to they funding your bike replacement, and one of these is that they ask its users to double lock their bikes.
 Speaker 3
So when you lose the bike for example.
 Speaker 3
You need to share them two keys to like.
 Speaker 3
Prove that you double lock the bike.
 Speaker 3
How do you feel about a company telling you what to do in relation to the use of the product?
 Speaker 1
I can understand it because 99 out of 100 times that again bikes get stolen. It's probably in a city like Amsterdam then, huh? It's guys where there's a lot of bike thieves an.
 Speaker 1
If you only have the normal lock, which we're all used to if you not living in those students, big places on one lock is fine, but for a thief to take that one log off and replace it, it takes 30 seconds.
 Speaker 1
So I can understand that they want you to prove that you have at least locked it with something better than a lock that can be taken off and replaced within 30 seconds.
 Speaker 1
If you won't take that effort.
 Speaker 1
Yeah understandable.
 Speaker 1
So yeah, I do agree with that that rule they have.
 Speaker 2
Very nice.
 Speaker 1
Yeah, there's some talented thieves out there.
 Speaker 2
Yeah.
 Speaker 2


 Speaker 2
For sure, and it *****
 Speaker 4
Uh huh.
 Speaker 3
Yeah.
 Speaker 3
Uhm, yeah, go ahead.
 Speaker 3
Fine, go ahead.
 Speaker 3


 Speaker 2
Yeah, So what we we?
 Speaker 2
A bit talked over this question like would you feel guilty if you would damage or lose the swap feeds?
 Speaker 2
You said that you have the idea that you feel less.
 Speaker 2
Yeah.
 Speaker 1
It depends how.
 Speaker 1
Bad it is.
 Speaker 1
I mean if I literally lose it, I might feel bad and guilty about it.
 Speaker 1
But if it's something I have no influence on then forget a flat tire, or if something breaks because someone else throws my bike on the ground or whatever, then I wouldn't feel guilty.
 Speaker 1
I would just be really happy with the surface.
 Speaker 1
That they provide 'cause if it's my own bike, I would be really mad that it got broken and that I would have to like get it fixed by someone and pay for it.
 Speaker 1
But will swap feeds?
 Speaker 1
They do it for you so it makes you a little less scared that something happens to your.
 Speaker 1
Like
 Speaker 2
OK, reassurance X yeah very nice.
 Speaker 1
Yeah, yeah.
 Speaker 1
Yeah.
 Speaker 2
OK then that's all about responsibility that we wanted to ask.
 Speaker 2
The next thing is compatibility.
 Speaker 2
We already asked a bit about your lifestyle but.
 Speaker 2
We go into that a bit more so you.
 Speaker 1
Papa
 Speaker 2
You're OK.
 Speaker 2
I like do you feel that you had to adjust your normal lives, your normal cycling life cycle lifestyle with a swap fixed?
 Speaker 2
Do you feel that that is compatible to each other or that you had to alter anything?
 Speaker 2
Dash silent OK.
 Speaker 3
Yes.
 Speaker 1
And my connection dropped.
 Speaker 2
Oh
 Speaker 2
Oh, should I repeat the question or?
 Speaker 1
Yes please.
 Speaker 2
OK, so it's it's about compatibility and with your lifestyle, so do you think you would have to adjust your normal cycling lifestyle?
 Speaker 2
When you would swap your private bike or second hand bike for a swap feeds, do you think that you had to adjust anything to swap those?
 Speaker 1
Compared to the bike I currently use.
 Speaker 1
No.
 Speaker 1
But if I were to buy a bike for myself later on, I would buy a more sportsy bike.
 Speaker 1
I I wouldn't go for the swap, which is very much aimed at people living in a city where they're just used to go buy groceries.
 Speaker 1
Have someone else on the back of your bike and go through the the pub or whatever you know.
 Speaker 1
But I would probably prefer having yeah more hybrid kind of design for myself.
 Speaker 2
Yeah.
 Speaker 3
And what do you think?
 Speaker 3
So please is adopted by fellow students.
 Speaker 3
They already touched a little bit upon that.
 Speaker 3
This, can you elaborate a little bit?
 Speaker 1
I think because a lot of people don't own a bike or they don't want to move their bike to the city where they like moving.
 Speaker 1
It's mainly used by I think, students if I'm not.
 Speaker 1
Wrong.
 Speaker 1
Uhm, and they don't want to have to go through the hassle of doing anything.
 Speaker 2
Thanks for this.
 Speaker 1
Like fixing it there, they want to have a complete solution.
 Speaker 1
And that is exactly what we should fix this.
 Speaker 3
Yep, Yep.
 Speaker 3
Yeah.
 Speaker 3


 Speaker 3
And how do you differ from these people that have?
 Speaker 3
That you just described.
 Speaker 1
An I don't.
 Speaker 1
Except for I don't want to pay that much for that complete solution there.
 Speaker 1
That everyone has their own line of how much they think it's worth.
 Speaker 2
Uh huh.
 Speaker 3
And uhm.
 Speaker 3
Do you feel attached to your bike?
 Speaker 1
Yeah, yeah, I think I do, yeah.
 Speaker 3
In what way?
 Speaker 1
You get used to how it is, how it feels.
 Speaker 1
I mean, I'm used to cycling on various.
 Speaker 1
Bikes that have their own instruction book on how to use so to say OK.
 Speaker 1
Secondhand bike users can relate.
 Speaker 3
Definitely.
 Speaker 1
Yeah, so of course yeah I feel with my bikes that I mean the gears are a bit broken, but I know how to use them.
 Speaker 3
Yeah.
 Speaker 1
So in that way, it's like I I know how everything works on the bike, so I am a bit used to how it works on the bike as well, so that's what I'm attached to.
 Speaker 4
Yep.
 Speaker 3
Very nice and would you feel that's attached to a swap feed spike then?
 Speaker 1
If I keep the same bike for a long period, yes, but if it's if it switches out a lot, then no.
 Speaker 2
So it's really the.
 Speaker 2
Feeling and the gears and the yeah.
 Speaker 1
Yeah, yeah yeah, you get used to using it.
 Speaker 2
So what a way of cycling actually?
 Speaker 1
Yeah.
 Speaker 2
Interesting, very nice.
 Speaker 2
That's everything about compatibility.
 Speaker 2
Uh, do you have a?
 Speaker 2
A perspective on the brand of shop fits in general like where it stands for or.
 Speaker 2
How you view them?
 Speaker 1
And.
 Speaker 1
We know them because other students use it, so that's the point of view where I'm looking at it from as a luxury product mainly used by students and people that don't own a bike themselves.
 Speaker 2
Yes, so you know quite a few of them AM.
 Speaker 2
Does that help you get to know the product and would?
 Speaker 2
Hope you get one or.
 Speaker 4
Yeah you do, you do.
 Speaker 1
See them quite often, of course.
 Speaker 1
So.
 Speaker 1
I think it does help.
 Speaker 1
Because of course you get.
 Speaker 1
Influenced by those people and you see how they like the bike or how they won't like the bike so that obviously will influence.
 Speaker 1
And if you would use it or not and.
 Speaker 1
If it works perfect for a lot of friends, then yeah, that would probably influence me and thinking maybe maybe I would also like this.
 Speaker 4
Sure.
 Speaker 2
Have you ever written on a shopping bag?
 Speaker 4
No, no, I have never.


OK.
 Speaker 2
Good to know and then the last thing about bike ownership like how do you feel relate to that in comparing to yet losing actually a product instead of having it as your own.
 Speaker 1
Yeah, I think.
 Speaker 1
I think for myself long term it wouldn't be worth getting a swap fits because I prefer to just buy my bike.
 Speaker 1
And if you are appropriate with your bike and careful then you can keep your bike for 10 years or 20 or 30 or 40.
 Speaker 1
And not have to spend that much money on.
 Speaker 1
But if you translate that into swap feeds subscription money, that's a lot of lot of money.
 Speaker 3
Yeah.
 Speaker 2
Very good bike.
 Speaker 2
Very very good bike at the end.
 Speaker 1
Yeah, that's a.
 Speaker 1
Really nice bike.
 Speaker 1
You can buy from that money at the end, yeah?
 Speaker 4
Yeah.
 Speaker 2
Because that's also the last barrier.
 Speaker 2
Actually, the economic concerns like.
 Speaker 2
Any field about the?
 Speaker 2
Subscription model rather than buying a secondhand bike.
 Speaker 1
I think because it's a subscription overtime.
 Speaker 1
You lose the value.
 Speaker 1
In it.
 Speaker 1
Because currently you pay for swap feats.


Yeah.
 Speaker 2
Look at it up.
 Speaker 1
Yes.
 Speaker 2
Not.
 Speaker 2
I think it's well.
 Speaker 4
Compared to 12 euros.
 Speaker 1
Four students a month.
 Speaker 2
Yeah.
 Speaker 1
So I mean you're you're gonna use it for years and I can get a second hand bike that is like decent for between €5200. So in a year you've really like made that money out of the bank. It's €144 a year today.
 Speaker 1
You swap feeds, they do take away.
 Speaker 1
Like all the risk of you having to repair it's blah blah blah, but if you are careful with your bike then you can buy one bike for €144 and use it for five years and save a grand total of €720.
 Speaker 2
Well.
 Speaker 2
Oh
 Speaker 2
Yeah, the financial part is.
 Speaker 2
A big part for you.
 Speaker 2
The part for you.
 Speaker 2


 Speaker 1
Yeah, I mean isn't that the biggest boundary for everyone you look at what it's worth for you?
 Speaker 3
Yeah.
 Speaker 3


 Speaker 1
And if they offer anything within the range that you think is worth your money and do you need it?
 Speaker 1
Do I need these services?
 Speaker 1
No, are they nice?
 Speaker 1
Yeah, OK, then I'm going to look at would I pay for this?
 Speaker 1
No?
 Speaker 1
OK, and then it's not for me.
 Speaker 2
Yeah.
 Speaker 2
So the monetary deal, if it's one, is bad and five is good.
 Speaker 2
Where would you say that it will be for you?
 Speaker 1
Probably in the middle around the three.
 Speaker 2
Right, yeah?


Right?
 Speaker 4
It's a little bit like a Spotify subscription.
 Speaker 4
Five years a month, 12 year olds builds up so fast.
 Speaker 2
Yes, yeah.
 Speaker 1
I I can't really say that 'cause like your mobile phone subscription is also usually around like €15 or more, but.


Sure.
 Speaker 4
Yeah.


Yeah.
 Speaker 2
Yeah and well, the main thing is that if you use it more than a year or two years, you really literally already paid off the whole bike and they don't make a difference in that if you should.
 Speaker 1
Yeah.
 Speaker 4
Yeah.
 Speaker 2
If they don't have a rule about if your subscription have it for more than two years, the price goes down or something that you actually.
 Speaker 4
Yeah it would.
 Speaker 2
For that, if you have less repairs then it gets cheaper.
 Speaker 1
If they do something like yeah yeah, if you keep it longer it gets cheaper.
 Speaker 1
If you don't claim any repairs it gets cheaper.
 Speaker 1
That would be that would be something where I would like consider Oh yeah, yeah then.
 Speaker 1
Then maybe it will be worth it.
 Speaker 2
Because there is an option to decrease the financial barrier.
 Speaker 1
Yeah, definitely, just currently it's just the permanent price and you are also going to think in a way like I want to get my money's worth out of this at least.


Interesting.
 Speaker 1
So I don't know if I if if I don't break anything or whatever, then why am I paying this much for this service?
 Speaker 2
Yeah.
 Speaker 4
Let's break it.


Yeah.
 Speaker 2
That's actually the other way around.
 Speaker 2
Let's make it cheaper.
 Speaker 2
Otherwise people break it.
 Speaker 2
OK, I think well we have done all the questions except for if you would like to add anything that you want to get out over your bike or the disrupted service.
 Speaker 2
If you have anything to add.
 Speaker 4
No, no, no, I don't think so.
 Speaker 2
Very good then.
 Speaker 2
Thank you very much for your elaborate answers and this very nice conversation.


Yeah.
 Speaker 1
You're welcome.
 Speaker 2
Nice.
 Speaker 2
Then there was it.
 Speaker 2
We can stop the recording and almost done with all the interviews.
 Speaker 3
Yes.
