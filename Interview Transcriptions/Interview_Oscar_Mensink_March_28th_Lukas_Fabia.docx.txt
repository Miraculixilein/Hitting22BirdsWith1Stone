 Lukas
Ehm let's let's go to our interview.
Yeah, so we ... I sent you this, this Swapfiets video ... did you, did you see it or should we show it?
 Oscar
I did, yeah, 30 seconds, it was very short.
 Lukas
Exactly yeah, yeah.
 Oscar
It was very, very Dutch.
I see that they targeted specific markets.
 Lukas
Exactly so we're interested in investigating Swapfiets or generally interested in access economies which is basically sharing economies but then with a different bit of nuance and then we are interested in the reason for non-adoption, so this is why I said, you must be a this and that old and you must never have used a Swapfiets so far and then we basically going to hop through some barriers that have that the literature is like throwing at us and but before that, I would like we would need some clarifying questions about your background.
So if you could briefly state what your name is, how old you are, and what your general occupation is.
 Oscar
I my name is Oscar Mensink. I am 25 years old. I'm currently studying computer science with a previous degree in politics and sociology. I am what's known as a forever student. And I'm here to help.
 Lukas
I didn't know you did this social social stuff as well. I thought you did, only computer science. right? Yeah. Chique! And so, first of all, I know you own a bike but maybe you can tell us a bit about your biking habits and what you think of Swapfiets.
 Oscar
OK. Swapfiets is extremely convenient, I totally understand why it's a great concept. And the idea of not having to repair your own bike, having a subscription to a bike that actually works really well. 'cause I've also I've had friends that have spiked and they're always extremely happy with it.
 Sprecher 4
Uh huh?
 Oscar
And ... my history with bikes is that I was taught to fix them. And ... by my dad and also repair bikes for other people, sometimes, my dad used to do that quite a lot and he take parts of older bikes and sometimes put them together. So we could give a bike away to a friend or whatever, so I guess that's kind of handed, passed down to me, I guess. And if I were to have kids myself, I would probably make them have their own bike and teach them the same things. Because it's been extremely useful and it also you should know whatever kind of equipment you're using but I have considered getting a similar setup as a Swapfiets because I have never bought my own bike brand new and then maintained it. I've only gotten second hand bikes and then maintained it and there's always something wrong.
 Lukas
Yeah indeed it is. Wow, you just coverd, I, I have my here's the interview and here's my here's my screen with with the questions, you just covered like a whole lot of those, but to just state it explicitly: Suppose if I would breakdown now, this very moment, would you consider getting a Swapfiets?
 Oscar
Probably not. I would do all I can to save my own money and fix it myself.
 Lukas
Ah OK, yeah, I see nice.
 Fabia
Interesting.
 Lukas
I mean, you said you have a bike, but maybe you can - and you have basically always had second hand bikes like, how often do you use your bike and for how long has that been?
Oscar
My current bike I've been using for a year and a half, but previously, my dad owned it for about four years. Before that, and before that again, I was the main user for about a year and a half or so.
 Lukas
Yeah, I see.
 Oscar
Still a second hand bike back then, still working now. It has had reparation of use. I would estimate that my dad did not cycle it very frequently. I would cycle it. Not daily at the moment due to Corona, but I would otherwise. And it's been daylight daily before. Wait, we rephrase, what was the question again? So I might have gone off topic.
 Lukas
The question is, how often do you use it and for how long is up roughly been?
 Oscar
Yeah OK yeah, so that yeah the the history of my bike is essentially that it's frequency is quite still ... frequency of use is still every second day, I'd say
 Lukas
Yeah, I also got a second hand bike from the ... I live next to a bike store. And I'm kind of friends with the with the owners of them, and I got a second hand back from them and they said, yeah, this might be like from the 1980's. I really wish that sometimes people would put like tiny papers on their on their bikes and like "I owned this bike from this and then" for the.
 Oscar
You can find the serial code and probably Google it if you find the serial code on any piece of the bikes or different parts of a serial code. But it really depends. Maybe if you ... if you said it was from the 1800s then maybe not.
 Lukas
Yeah, it was just  really assembled from just parts lying around, but yeah. You already touched upon on your view on Swapfiets and could you just explicitly say what your personal pros and cons for Swapfietsfeats, for adopting Swapfiets would be?
 Oscar
At the biggest Pro is convenience, and the convenience includes the fact that the bike will always be running. You can grab a new one if it isn't. If it does break, you get to literally swap it straight away so the conveniences saving of time. Aside from that they also ensure it. Uhm ... I know they insure it. I don't know if that ensures you if you specifically break things in serious circumstances, right? But anyway, those are the conveniences.
 Oscar
The cons are. It is more expensive than taking care of your own bike and the tips and tricks if you know them, when know them then it's nearly habitual. Just take care of your bike.
 Oscar
Yeah, that's literally it . I have not ... I'm not a high earner. I might as well keep a cheap bike. In the future, I'll probably get an expensive bike and then learn even more on how to take care of that, because then I'll have a good bike and I'll probably put a bit more money in it, maybe a bit more than Swapfiets would ever charge, but it would probably be a bit a higher level bike. And also I think swap feats currently only offers one bike. Am I wrong?
 Lukas
They offer multiple versions.
 Fabia
Yeah, well for also more premium they actually also offer an electric bike.
 Lukas
Yeah indeed. So, all the delivery services are getting the electric ones now, so they're making a lot of money with this pandemic there.
 Lukas
There's a barrier, which is the complexity of the subscription process and you touched upon that in your in your pros when you said it's, it's convenient and it's like easy to get in. But ...
 Oscar
Yeah, I think there's, there's a barrier of setup, but I wouldn't if ... if I decided to do something that's a single like it's a momentary barrier. You pass it once and then you're sort of in.
 Lukas
So, complicated, easy, ...?
 Oscar
I, I wouldn't say it really like it as you said it is a barrier, but it's not one that I would that would dissuade me from getting it. It would be more the long term conveniences.

[General stammering]

 Lukas
And you already said there's, there's the service or Swapfiets, which is if you break your bike to some extent they replace it for you.
 Lukas
How ... ehm what was your perception of how complex or complicated that is to use?
 Oscar
Not very. There's two options from at least at least the video I got. It was one they can actually come and pick it up and just swap it for you if you're out and about, you might have to pay a small fee for that, or you can go as I've been told, you can just go to one of their stores and get an instant swap there.

[General stammering]

 Fabia
So you talked about that, so you do a lot of repair of your bikes yourself and that probably if you're going to invest in a bike you invest in a like more expensive or like better bike but I'm curious like what do you actually think of about like Swapfiets and do you know, or what do you think about its performance like in the service works with repairs or like the bike itself?
 Oscar
Yeah, it's perfect setup for someone who doesn't already have the skills to take care of a bike, to be honest. So I would yeah, I would argue that if I, I had never been taught to take care of a bike, I probably would see this option and go "Yeah, that's probably cheaper than me paying for someone else to fix my bike all the time", so Swapfiets could actually be jumping into the market of taking out cyclist shops or bike shops because everyone who's going to be in a bike shop or ... bike shops can sign up to be also Swapfiets people. That's may be an option that saves them from having to get rid of their business and also offer Swapfiets more access like way more access they could ask for banners and stuff is like "Oh if you do this, then you'll have work from us and also you have ... whatever." But if you're if you are actually going to go talk to Swapfiets, I would highly advise suggesting them to set up some sort of contract where they can go to normal fietsenmaakers and set that up but ... I've lost my topic yet again ...
 Lukas
Have you ever thought of pursuing your consultant period? This is unrelated to the Swapfiets topic. You're just like "idea, idea, idea, idea, ..."
 Oscar
At that, yeah, it would be nice.
 Lukas
So the the notion of quality of this, of the Swapfiets, has been hopping around a bit in what you said, so if you, if you were to rate on like a scale from like one to five, five is the absolute max and one is the lowest, to what extent is Swapfiet a good, a sturdy product?
 Oscar
Do you mean the bike or do you mean the monthly subscription or the thing as a whole?
 Lukas
I meant the bike itself.
 Oscar
For bike itself I have been very impressed by the bike. I have cycled one and I was like "oh wow, it's perfect." The tires are slightly large to make sure it doesn't get damaged. The frames are sturdy, you can knock it about. It's a bit like, I think they did put time and effort into making sure they had a cheap but also durable bike. So yeah, I yeah, I probably I probably gave five stars because I knew they were [inaudible]
 Lukas
Wow, So what?
 Lukas
Yeah, just, just as a  verification you have used like a Swapfiets of a friend will exactly so you haven't adopted one?
 Oscar
I have I have not, I've never, I've never even did a lending 'cause I think they also let you use it for two weeks or something and then come back as long as you put in a [indaubile, "boergh" maybe?] .
 Lukas
Oh, I don't know that to be honest. So, after you praising th Swapfiets is it ... If you were compare it to private cycles in general - would it perform or underperform?
 Oscar
Compared to my current bike?
 Lukas
To private cycles, maybe in general, maybe to yours and to, well, what you think of your friends' bikes?
 Oscar
Well, my friend just bought a bike for 1800, so I think that ... I think, I think his bike is going to do a lot better. It's probably made of a lighter material and also has just a sturdier frame, and also has loads of additional options to add to it. And I think he's going to invest another 200, 300 into that as well.
 Lukas
If we say we go to, we go to Olympos - practice on Monday, I hope to see you there then - then if you compare the bikes that you see there with Swapffiets feet.
 Oscar
No, Swapfiets is usually on top. If you look around ... and Swapfiets it's also distinguished, which is nice. The idea of actually coloring their tyres was very very smart move.
 Lukas
Ridiculously clever, eh? And then also the frames are differently colored. Yeah, so, this is ... the the question I just asked is a bit about the bike itself and then the other part of Swapfiets which you already identified really, really nicely is the ... that of the repair part. So, is there ... I would be interested in if you think that the Swapfiets repair service would outperform private repairs, or like repair shops.
 Oscar
Yes. So there's an increased cost of having a ... like, so let me just let me double check and see if this is right. Swapfiets you have the abonnement so you have a ... subscription. You have your subscription and that subscription includes repairs, correct, maybe to a maximum set of repairs per year if you're really overdoing it, but that's unlikely to happen 'cause you're coherent user. So the nice thing about that for Swapfiets is htat they have a constant income whereas someone who is a bike shop, they increase their rate a little bit because they have inconsistencies, so sometimes they might be extra busy and sometimes they might not be busy enough and so their rates go up whereas for Swapfiets, it would be slightly lower, I would expect, and you would also have a guarantee on your bike.
 Oscar
So, if ... again, I refer back to it,  if you can't repair your own bike, you probably are going to have increased costs. If your bike is one of the standard bikes around the area because these bikes are falling to bits.
 Lukas
Well, you touched about ... like where we're basically at the end is one barrier right now and I'm just thinking of which one to go to. But maybe, while I think of it, you can say to extend would you trust the company or the service to supply you with the with replacement in time?
 Oscar
Quite a, quite, ... Very, very high. I've seen, I've seen their stores and if I was to have a Swapfiets myself, I would probably go and swap it in the store itself. And they will, they will literally say, "oh we'll take this bike in.", it'll be numbered and they'll give you a different bike straight away if that's what you prefer yeah, so yeah.

 Fabia
Well, in relation to you like investing a lot of your time and money in your own bike, I was wondering when it comes to for example, your responsibility to, ... How do you feel about your own bike compared to for example ... How responsible you would feel to a leased bike like Swapfiets?
 Oscar
I guess ... here's one downside to my history of bikes is that I have, I have lost a lot of bikes to it being stolen but it is never cost me more because I've always been given second hand bikes. So, I would probably lock up the bike as well with two locks because I would hate to come out to see my bike gone, yet again. The convenience of still having a bike after you've cycled 40 minutes and you have to cycle 40 minutes to go home would probably still be there. But as in maybe knocking it down and stuff... I think I would probably sooner, if it was a grass pitch, probably knock down the Swapfiets bike and just lay it on its side rather than use the stand. Don't know, I just it's sturdier. My bike is a bit more fickle. And I just noted, yeah, yeah, yeah, I know the Swapfets can take it and also it is covered. Yeah, I might be a little worse than my current bike, but my current bike is also like, less able to take a hit like that.
 Lukas
You mentioned you mentioned the double look and it is literally the very next question: Swapfiets is indeed asking its users to use this double lock. How would that make you feel, a company telling you what to do with the product that you're getting from them?
 Oscar
Part of the contract, they could, they could put it in their contracts.
 Lukas
So like it is part of your responsibility as a as a user, or how is that?
 Oscar
If you agree to the terms, yeah, ... If they ask me "Oh, do you want to always double lock it and pay less" - because there's less likely than having tofind my Swapfiest thing again - "or pay a little more and then have to only lock it once?" That would make me understand or accept the choice, so it's my choice now, but it's in the contract and you your increased pay is probably like, if you only have one lock, your increased pay is probably going towards them finding stolen bikes, but they have a good system for finding them because they can track them, but it does cost resources to do so.
 Lukas
To actually do it then yeah. That's a that's a really cool idea to have a different mode of looking.
 Fabia
So, you already talked about kind of of yeah being like kind of watching out for their like own bike more than for your Swapfiets just because you think like the Swapfiets is more sturdy product, but would you feel guilty if you would damage or lose your Swapfiets? And why?
 Oscar
No, I would treat it as my own product and if I break my own product, I don't usually feel guilty. I feel a bit disappointed because I now have a broken product. So guilty might not be the right word, but I might, I would, I would feel disappointed in myself for having lost said bike or have having damaged it because I probably wouldn't put in the effort to go swap it until I really needed to as well.
 Lukas
Uh huh.
 Oscar
Yeah, but this is really convenient-me talking like I could also be out drinking an evening and then maybe not treating it [inaudible]. I'm being honest, it happened.
 Lukas
Yeah, absolutely right. I'm just thinking of how how all our papers are really not considering different aspects in users: So, like, what if you're like just drunk and not really careful when you and then something happens?
 Fabia
Uh huh.
 Lukas
You know, users are usually that homogeneous gray mass of people who make the same ... but yeah ... Sorry, let's, I kind of want to go, I kinda wanna go about economic concerns because yeah, because you, uhm, you said that in the responsibility part. So, there's a subscription model instead of rather buying one time. ow do you feel about it being a subscription model rather than a buying model?
 Oscar
Uhm ... Fine? Fine, that's... yeah I, I see the convenience in it. It also means I don't have to have like a wad of cash saved up in case my bike does go missing, which is nice.
 Lukas
Uh, huh, Oh yeah, that's a, uh huh.
 Oscar
But if you are talking about economics, it's still ... I still save more money by not signing up to Swapfiets currently, so.
 Lukas
Yeah, yeah we go, it goes into economic concerns and frugality, that's that's the category at the moment.
 Lukas
Uhm, so on a scale from one to five, where five is the best again or like the max, is Swapfiets presenting a good monetary deal to you?
 Oscar
I don't know. I don't know how much it costs.
 Lukas
OK, how how much do you think it is like? What would you ...?
 Oscar
I would expect it to range between 20 and €40 months.
 Lukas
Yeah, yeah.
 Lukas
I'll be like.
 Oscar
Well, I I I don't know if I'd like 30 a month, 12, that's like, it's a lot of money, it's €200. That's more than I've ever spent on a bike, I think, in one go. I've never spent more than €100 and then maybe during reparations €50 on a bad year, maybe no €80, probably, on a bad year and €20 in a Goodyear.
 Lukas
Yeah, Fabia, are we allowed to tell him like how much, how much, some models are?
 Fabia
Ah yeah, I'm looking at the price, actually.
 Lukas
But it's 12 something, I think.
 Oscar
€12 a month?
Yeah, for like students and cheapest model.
 Oscar
There's no ... Is there, on the on the 12 euro model, is there any gears?
 Lukas
I don't think so.
 Lukas
So Swapfiets has also been used before, right, so, the same as your second hand bike. Is there ... What are your views on Swapfiets possibly having been used before? Like, if you go to the store and it's like, okay, it's not, it's not a new bike, it's not ...
 Oscar
Well, currently, my expectation of Swapfiets is that they take care of the models they have, so it wouldn't be that bad. They should be OK.
 Lukas
The category extends into like aversion or disgust towards the product being contaminated is that, do you think in terms of Swapfiets being contaminated like this?
 Oscar
No, no, I do, I do understand the idea for some people to say "Oh I, have ownership over my own bike and it's mine." But I wouldn't feel, I wouldn't feel that my bike was contaminated because someone else would have cycled it.
 Lukas
So scale from one to five, again 5 the highest, 1 the lowest.
 Oscar
5 being the most contaminated with the least it can ...?
 Lukas
The most contaminated, sorry, yeah.
 Oscar
Oh, that I wouldn't ... 1? 0. I don't know. I don't really mind.
 Lukas
Alright, yeah, perfect, perfect. Second to last thing is, is compatibility so ...Would you, would you have to adjust your normal cycling lifestyle like your normal cycling style with the Swapfiets?
 Oscar
Yes, it wouldn't have gears. I'd probably go for the cheapest version and it wouldn't have gears.
 Lukas
OK like it would, it would maybe take longer or whatever, but generally, it wouldn't change much?
 Oscar
Does it, does it come with straps on the back of the bike?
 Lukas
I think it doesn't have something on the back of the bike. It has something at the front, but it doesn't have straps.
 Fabia
N, you can't take someone on the back of your bike.
 Oscar
Yeah, OK, they explicitly made the design such that, so that people don't get on the back of the bike. Also, if you ever on an OV bike, you're not legally allowed to have someone sitting on the back. And it's a fine of €250.
 Lukas
250?
 Fabia
What? F*ck!
 Oscar
Or sorry, up to 250, anyway. I was told this after asking someone who is giving me an OV bike. Anyway!
 Lukas
On the Swapfiets, they transport people on the front tire instead. Because there's this backie part, like, the thing that you have in the back normally, is now at the front tire and they just check for people there which utterly hard to steer.
 Oscar
I've seen people do this, yeah, but, I, I'm pretty sure you're not meant to do that, for sure. It's in your contract, they say "No, don't do this."
 Lukas
Yeah, pretty much.
 Fabia
I mean, we Dutchies carry everyone on our bikes or everything.
 Lukas
It's a certain lifestyle that the Dutch employ there, so, I think it's really interesting to, to think about the lifestyle, that, that Swapfiets stands for, you know? When you, when you say like "he was like carrying the other people on the, on the front tire even if you know .." Well, we're interested, we're interested in what kind of lifestyle you think Swapfiets actually stand for.
 Oscar
The lifestyle of Swapfiets? Well, I mean, I primarily see students on Swapfiets. I do have this feeling of ease of use And I don't really look at someone who's on a Swapfiets and say "Oh, they know how to fix their bike." They might, but I, I just usually assume they can not. This is not to say that it's a bad thing. It's just ... this is a skill I have a bit of value for.
 Lukas
So an introduction of this sentence, or in the first part, you said "based on what you see", so is that is another ... So, empirically, but is there another reason why you think that?
 Oscar
Well, it's like it's an assumption on my part. I don't know if this person has ... is able to fix a bike or not, I just assuming he can't, or she can't. And ... what else, I don't know ...
 Lukas
Also doesn't have to be a long elaborate essay on every question, so don't worry about it, right?
 Oscar
Yeah, I don't. I don't know. Full stop.
 Lukas
So fellow students, maybe yeah, others in than that area, why do you think they they use Swapfiets?
 Oscar
'cause it's a pretty good deal. You just told me as well. I was expecting between 20 and 40 euro. It's 12,50. It's a good deal, especially it's an easy way to get a bike you ... it's ... your bike is going to work and what's nice is you can't blame yourself, you don't have to blame yourself if it's not working you can blame someone else, which is probably nice.
 Lukas
That's an interesting comment for the follow up because I, we would like to know how you differ from these people. Do you? Do you blame him playing with yourself when it's broken?
 Oscar
Yeah, if my bike isn't working, it's my fault.
 Lukas
But yeah, how, how do you differ from them?
 Oscar
I don't know, like, I have friends who use these bikes.
 Oscar
That's why I've cycled it myself, it's just a different means.
 Lukas
This is such a such a nice answer like, "I don't."
 Oscar
Like, they have made their decision, I mean, I, I differ in like "I have decided not to use this bike. Full stop."
 Lukas
Yes, but assuming you would have one now, would you, so, you already talked a bit about attachment to your bike that you ...?
 Oscar
I am not attached to my bike
 Lukas
Yeah exactly, would you to a Swapfiets?
 Oscar
No.
 Lukas
Yeah, OK.
 Oscar
Probably not, I'd probably, but now that you've now that I've had this whole meeting, I probably would first check out Swapfiets before I decided to buy my own bike to see what the what the prices really are because fairly, I could probably get maybe a better bike and pay less than 15 a month.
 Lukas
Yeah, it's interesting after like talking to these people, we in total have seven interviews, and then, after been to the interview, they were like "I've never thought so much about Swapfiets." So nice to see like "now that I have this interview..." but we have one one last category which is about image barriers, so possible negative view of the brand, the country of origins, which is the Netherlands, or the innovation category. You touched upon that that greatly already. So how do you, how do you feel about Swapfiets as a brand?
 Oscar
Uhm, I have this sense of convenience from them. So when I hear swap feats, I'm like "Yeah, they they set up something that's super convenient for people." ... Yeah, I think actually, like if there was, if they did more advertising about the 12.50 a month slash whatever ... Yeah, but I'm, I'm annoyed at adverts, so I don't know if that would really work, but I can see it.
 Lukas
I can't really imagine you being really a person stalking the advertisement sections of whatever, so.
 Oscar
I, I don't, no, I have ... The convenience is that all that comes to mind when I think of Swapfiets. Full stop.
 Lukas
You already talked about friends who are using Swapfiets. So, let's say your your girlfriend, your friends, your family would start using Swapfiets or like ... would you, would you be more inclined then to use it like does that have any effect?
 Oscar
Probably not. I mean, only just, only talking about it like this would influence me. So if I was talking to my friends about swap feats like this, I would consider it. But that's what happened previously as well when I was trying out my friends bike I was like "whaaaat?" I think he did say 12.50 or something. It was crazy. I was like "That's, that's mad!" But then, yeah, I pay nothing for my bike now. I think I've paid €60.00, that also includes a fiets poemp, for a year and a half.
 Lukas
Chique, not bad. We have one in our hallway which we can all just collectively use.
 Oscar
I would highly advise getting a fiets poemp that has a measure on it if it doesn't have one.
 Lukas
Oh yeah, we have that. And then all the different adapters for the French or the normal thingy there. So, this entire interview is kind of hoping around the question of of bike ownership, so like, to what extend does a product, a bike need to be owned today? So our second-to-last question is actually how do you feel about bike ownership as a as a concept?
 Oscar
Erm. Yeah, I don't know. I don't really think about it. I have,m I have a bike, I have a means to get around. It's, it's just another transport method and I prefer, I prefer, I prefer getting around by bike or walking than using public transport.
 LukasB
 ut it doesn't really matter for you, if I yeah, if I get it right, it doesn't really matter to you whether it's like you, you own it or you get a subscription b just that you get around, tha's what most matters.
 Oscar
Yeah yeah, but I like if if I had to Swapfiets, my mentality would be constantly "Oh, just get someone else to fix it" and I don't really like that mentality. That's also something that's ingrained, it's just something my family was always said, like "if something is broken, fix it yourself." But then again, if I was super busy doing loads of other things all the time, which I usually am, sometimes, I don't fix my bike for a while and like "I'll just fix it later." ... Yeah, yeah, that's that's one negative thing. Yeah, I don't like I don't like that mentality of just swap the bike and get a new one because I think it, it also makes you think the same way about other things, but in this case it's perfect because they are literally fixing up the bike and reusing and recycling in the sense, as much as possible. But yeah, actually, that's a aversion I probably have. I like the idea of going "Ah, I'll fix it."
 Lukas
This is again a very beautiful transition to our last question, which is if there is anything that you would like to add or that has not been discussed or that has, has always been on your mind about Swapfiets or a revelation that you had today or ...?
 Oscar
Yeah, I guess that would be it, the ... I like the mentality of going "Ah, I'll fix it myself." And that's not present in Swapfiets.
 Lukas
Well, we have asked all the questions then so, I very, very much thank you for your time, highly appreciated. It was a little fun as well.
 Oscar
Good luck coding.
 Lukas
Yeah, good luck reading the report afterwards.
