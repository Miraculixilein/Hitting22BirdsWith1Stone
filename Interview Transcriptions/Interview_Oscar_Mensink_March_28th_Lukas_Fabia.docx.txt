 Lukas
Ehm let's let's go to our interview.
Yeah, so we ... I sent you this, this Swapfiets video ... did you, did you see it or should we show it?
 Oscar
I did, yeah, 30 seconds, it was very short.
 Lukas
Exactly yeah, yeah.
 Oscar
It was very, very Dutch.
I see that they targeted specific markets.
 Lukas
Exactly so we're interested in investigating Swapfiets or generally interested in access economies which is basically sharing economies but then with a different bit of nuance and then we are interested in the reason for non-adoption, so this is why I said, you must be a this and that old and you must never have used a Swapfiets so far and then we basically going to hop through some barriers that have that the literature is like throwing at us and but before that, I would like we would need some clarifying questions about your background.
So if you could briefly state what your name is, how old you are, and what your general occupation is.
 Oscar
I my name is Oscar Mensink. I am 25 years old. I'm currently studying computer science with a previous degree in politics and sociology. I am what's known as a forever student. And I'm here to help.
 Lukas
I didn't know you did this social social stuff as well. I thought you did, only computer science. right? Yeah. Chique! And so, first of all, I know you own a bike but maybe you can tell us a bit about your biking habits and what you think of Swapfiets.
 Oscar
OK. Swapfiets is extremely convenient, I totally understand why it's a great concept. And the idea of not having to repair your own bike, having a subscription to a bike that actually works really well. 'cause I've also I've had friends that have spiked and they're always extremely happy with it.
 Sprecher 4
Uh huh?
 Oscar
And ... my history with bikes is that I was taught to fix them. And ... by my dad and also repair bikes for other people, sometimes, my dad used to do that quite a lot and he take parts of older bikes and sometimes put them together. So we could give a bike away to a friend or whatever, so I guess that's kind of handed, passed down to me, I guess. And if I were to have kids myself, I would probably make them have their own bike and teach them the same things. Because it's been extremely useful and it also you should know whatever kind of equipment you're using but I have considered getting a similar setup as a Swapfiets because I have never bought my own bike brand new and then maintained it. I've only gotten second hand bikes and then maintained it and there's always something wrong.
 Lukas
Yeah indeed it is. Wow, you just coverd, I, I have my here's the interview and here's my here's my screen with with the questions, you just covered like a whole lot of those, but to just state it explicitly: Suppose if I would breakdown now, this very moment, would you consider getting a Swapfiets?
 Oscar
Probably.
 Oscar
I would do all I can to save my own money and fix it myself.
 Lukas
Ah OK, yeah, I see nice.
 Fabia
Interesting.
 Lukas
I mean, you said you have a bike, but maybe you can - and you have basically always had second hand bikes like, how often do you use your bike and for how long has happened.
 Fabia
It's
 Oscar
My current bike I've been using for a year and a half, but previously my dad owned it for about four years.
 Oscar
Before that, and before that again, I was the main user.
 Oscar
For about a year and a half or so.
 Lukas
Yeah, I see.
 Oscar
Still a second hand bike back then.
 Oscar
Still working now.
 Oscar
It has had reparation of use.
 Oscar
I would estimate that my dad did not select it very frequently.
 Oscar
I would cycle it.
 Oscar
Right?
 Oscar


 Oscar
Not daily at the moment due to Corona, but I would otherwise it would've been daylight daily before.
 Lukas
Uh huh.
 Lukas
Yeah.
 Oscar
Wait, we rephrase, what was the question again?
 Oscar
So I might have gone off topic.
 Lukas
I don't know, it's just that.
 Lukas
The question is, how often do you use it and for how long is up roughly been?
 Lukas
So you need to edit out.
 Oscar
Yeah OK yeah, so that yeah the the history of my bike is essentially that it's frequency is quite still frequency of use is still every second day I'd say.
 Oscar
Frequency.
 Oscar


 Fabia
OK.
 Lukas
Yeah, I also got a second hand bike from the I live next to a bike.
 Lukas
And I'm kind of friends with the with the owners of them, and I got a second hand back from them and they said, yeah, this might be like from the.
 Lukas
Yeah.
 Lukas
1987
 Oscar
Yes.
 Lukas
I I really wish that sometimes people would put like tiny papers on their on their bikes and like I owned this bike from this and then for the.
 Lukas
But yeah.
 Oscar
You can find the serial code and probably Google it if you find the serial code on any piece of the bikes or different parts of a serial code.
 Oscar
But it really depends. Maybe if you if you said it was from the 1800s.
 Oscar
Maybe not, but.
 Lukas
Yeah, it matters to be really assembled from just parts lying around, but yeah.
 Sprecher 4
It's
 Fabia
Sure.
 Lukas
Move touch depending on your view on surface and could you just explicitly say what your personal pros and cons for feats for adopting swap fix will be.
 Oscar
At the biggest Pro is convenience, and the convenience includes the fact that the bike will always be running.
 Oscar
You can grab a new one if.
 Oscar
Isn't if it does break, you get to literally swap it straight away so the conveniences saving of time.


Yes.
 Oscar
Aside from that they also ensure it.
 Oscar
M.
 Oscar
I will I know they insure it.
 Oscar
I don't know if that ensures you if you specifically break things in serious circumstances, right?
 Oscar
But anyway, add, those are the conveniences.
 Oscar
Thanks.
 Oscar


 Oscar
The cons are.
 Oscar
It is more expensive than taking care of your own bike and the tips and tricks if you know them when know them then it's nearly habitual.
 Oscar
Just take care of your bike.
 Oscar
Ah.
 Oscar
So.
 Oscar
Yeah, that's literally I have not.
 Oscar
I'm not a high earner.
 Oscar
I might as well keep it cheap back in the future, I'll probably get an expensive bike and then learn even more on how to take care of that, because then I'll have a good bike and I'll.
 Lukas
Yes she did.
 Oscar
Probably put a bit more money in it, maybe a bit more than swap eats would ever charge, but it would probably be a bit a higher level bike.
 Oscar
And also I think swap feats currently only offers one bike.
 Oscar
Am I wrong?
 Lukas
They offer multiple versions.
 Fabia
Me.
 Fabia
Yeah.
 Fabia
Yeah, well for also more premium the actually also from electric bike.
 Lukas
Yeah indeed.
 Lukas
So the delivery services are getting the electric sockets now, so they're making a lot of money with this pandemic there.
 Oscar
Yeah.
 Lukas
There's no, it doesn't.
 Lukas
Vary, which is the complexity of the subscription process and you touched upon that in your in your purse when you said it's it's convenient and it's like easy to get in, it's like but.
 Fabia
Yes.
 Oscar
Yeah, I think there.
 Oscar
Is there is a barrier of setup, but I wouldn't if if I decided to do something that's a single like it's a momentary barrier.
 Oscar
You pass it once and then you're sort of in.
 Fabia
Yeah.
 Lukas
So so complicated easy.
 Oscar
I, I wouldn't say it really like it as you said it is a barrier, but it's not one that I would that would dissuade me from getting it.
 Oscar
It would be more the long term conveniences.
 Lukas
Yeah, and about the author costs.
 Fabia
Feet.
 Oscar
Sorry.
 Oscar
Yeah.
 Oscar


 Lukas
No worries so, and you already said there's there's the service or swap feats, which is if you break your bike to some extent they replace it for you.
 Lukas
How?
 Fabia
Yeah.
 Lukas
What was your perception of how complex or complicated that is to use?
 Oscar
Not very.
 Oscar
There's two options from at least at least the video I got.
 Oscar
I was one they can actually come and pick it up and just swap it for you if you're out and about, you might have to pay a small fee for that, or you can go as I've been told, you can just go to one of their stores and get an instant swap there.


What?
 Oscar
Yeah.
 Oscar


 Lukas
Yeah, well, least in repair.
 Lukas
Yeah indeed.
 Oscar
Yeah.
 Lukas
Right?
 Lukas
Anne.
 Lukas
The the oh please go ahead sorry oh.
 Fabia
Yeah, no so you talked about that, so do a lot of repair of your bikes yourself and that probably if you're going to invest in a bike you invest in our like more expensive or like.
 Fabia
Better bike but I'm.
 Fabia
Curious like what do you actually think of about like swap feeds and
 Fabia
Do you know what do you think about its performance like in the service works with repairs or like the bank itself?
 Oscar
Yeah, it's perfect setup for someone who doesn't already have the skills to take care of a bike to be honest.
 Oscar
Yeah, it's perfect.
 Oscar


 Oscar
So I would yeah, I would argue that if I I had never been taught to take care of, like I probably would see this option and go.
 Oscar
Yeah, that's probably cheaper than me paying for someone else to fix my bike.
 Oscar
All the.
 Oscar
Time so swap feats could actually be jumping into the market of taking out.
 Sprecher 4
Uh huh?
 Oscar
Cyclist shops or bike shops.
 Oscar
Because everyone who's going to be in a bike shop or bike shops can sign up to be also swap these people.
 Fabia
She mask.
 Oscar
That may be an option that saves them from having to get rid of their business and also offer swap feats more an.
 Oscar
Access like way more access they could ask for banners and stuff is like oh if you do this then you'll have work from us and also you have whatever.
 Oscar
But if you're if you are actually going to go talk to swap meets, I would highly advise suggesting them to set up some sort of contract where they can go to normal feats of backers and set that up but.
 Oscar
I've lost my topic yet again, just I.
 Lukas
Have you ever thought of pursuing your consultant period?
 Lukas
This is unrelated.
 Lukas
Hope it's OK.
 Oscar
Ann
 Lukas
Yet I still like idea, idea, idea, idea.
 Oscar
At that, yeah, it would be nice.
 Oscar
If yeah, based quite a bit as.
 Oscar
Well, I hear.
 Lukas
Yeah.
 Lukas
So the the notion of quality of this has been helping around a bit in what you said, so if you if you were to rate in like escape from like one to five.
 Lukas
5 by 5 is the absolute Max and one is the lowest.
 Lukas
To what extent is is?
 Lukas
Is this what feeds a good?
 Lukas
Start the product which would be like this.
 Lukas
Wiki wiki site.
 Lukas


 Oscar
Do you mean the bike or do you mean the monthly subscription or the thing as a whole like?
 Lukas
I meant the bike itself.
 Oscar
For bike itself I have been very impressed by the bike.
 Oscar
I have cycled one and I was like oh wow, it's perfect.
 Oscar
The tires are slightly large to make sure it doesn't get damaged.
 Oscar
The frames are sturdy, you can knock it about.
 Lukas
Uh huh.
 Oscar
It's a bit like I think they did.
 Oscar
They did put time and effort into making sure they had a cheap but also durable bike.
 Lukas
Uh huh.
 Oscar
Uhm?
 Oscar
So yeah, I yeah, I probably I probably gave five stars because I knew they were racist.
 Lukas
Wow, So what?
 Lukas
Yeah, just just.
 Lukas
Like verification you have.
 Fabia
Right.
 Lukas
Used like this.
 Lukas
What feats of a friend will exactly so you have you?
 Lukas
Have a job market OK?
 Lukas
Yeah, 'cause otherwise like no.
 Fabia
Yeah.
 Oscar
I have I have not.
 Oscar
I've never.
 Oscar
I've never even did a lending 'cause I think they also let you use it for two weeks or something and then come back.
 Oscar
As long as you put in a border.
 Lukas
Yeah.
 Lukas
Oh, I don't know that to be honest.
 Sprecher 4
Yes.
 Lukas
So after you praising this, what fits is that if you were compare it to.
 Lukas
Private cycles in general.
 Lukas
The swap feeds is a physical feature.
 Lukas
Would it perform or underperform?
 Oscar
Private compared to my current bike.
 Lukas
To private cycles, maybe in general maybe to your son too, but what you think of your friends bikes?
 Oscar
Well, my friend just bought a bike for 1800, so I think that.
 Lukas
Please advise.
 Oscar
I think I think his bike is going to do a lot better. It's probably made of a lighter material and also has just a sturdier frame, and also has loads of additional options to add to it. And I think he's going to invest another 200.
 Lukas
Yeah.
 Oscar
Yeah.
 Oscar
300 into that as well.
 Lukas
If we say we go to, we go.
 Lukas
To Olympus practice on Monday, I hope to see you there then.
 Lukas
Then if you compare the bikes that you said.
 Fabia
Yeah.
 Lukas
With your feet.
 Oscar
Now swap pieces, usually on top.
 Oscar
If you look around and swap feats and it's also distinguished, which is nice at the idea of actually coloring their tyres was very very smart move.
 Sprecher 4
Ah.
 Lukas
Search divine Jesus.
 Lukas
Ridiculously clever and then also the frames are differently colored.
 Lukas
That's actually better.
 Lukas
Yeah, an so this this is the the question I just asked is a bit about the the bike itself and then the other part of speech which you already identified really, really nicely is the that the repair.
 Lukas
But so is that I I would be interested in you think that the swap fields repair service would outperform private repairs.
 Lukas
Or like repair shops.
 Lukas
But not in the private repairs, yeah?
 Oscar
Yes.
 Oscar
So there's an increased cost of having a like, so let me just let me double check and see if this is right.
 Lukas
Yeah.
 Oscar
Anfal feeds have you have you know bottom and so you have a.


So.




 Oscar
Appointment covered subscription.
 Fabia
Search it.
 Oscar
Thank you.
 Oscar
You have your subscription and within that subscription includes repairs, correct?


Yes.
 Oscar
Yeah, OK, maybe to a maximum set of repairs per year.
 Oscar
Yeah, exactly exactly.
 Oscar


 Oscar
If you're really overdoing it, but that's unlikely to happen 'cause you're coherent user.
 Oscar
So the nice thing about that for swap pieces, they have a constant income.
 Oscar
Whereas someone who is a bike shop, they increase their rate a little bit because they have inconsistencies, so sometimes they might be extra busy and sometimes they might not be busy enough and so their rates go up whereas.
 Oscar
For swap feats, it would be slightly lower, I would expect, and you would also have a guarantee on your bike.
 Oscar
So.
 Oscar
If again, I refer back to it.
 Oscar
If you can't repair your own bike, you probably are going to have increased costs.
 Oscar
If your bike eats one of the standard bikes around the area because spikes are falling to bits.
 Lukas
Yeah.
 Lukas
Well, he touched about like where we're basically at the end is 1 barrier right now and I'm just thinking of living which which one to go.
 Lukas
But maybe while I think of it, you can pay to extend.
 Lukas
Would you trust the company or like this?
 Lukas
What the service?
 Lukas
To supply you with the with replacement in time, you already clearly kind of said.
 Oscar
Ann
 Lukas
That, but just to have it explicit.
 Oscar
Quite a quite.
 Oscar
Very, very high.
 Oscar
I've seen I've seen their stores an if I was to have a swap pizza myself.
 Oscar
I would probably go and swap it in the store itself.
 Lukas
Yeah.
 Lukas


 Oscar
Yeah, and they will.
 Oscar
They will literally say, oh we'll take this bike in.
 Oscar
It'll be numbered and they'll give you a different bike straight away.
 Fabia
If that's what you prefer yeah, so Oh yeah.
 Lukas
Yeah, yeah, indeed, that's why.
 Oscar
Yeah.
 Oscar


 Fabia
Well, in relation to you like investing a lot of your time and money.
 Fabia
Also in your own bike.
 Fabia
I was wondering when it comes to for example, your responsibility.
 Fabia
2.
 Fabia
How do you feel about your own bike compared to for example?
 Fabia
How responsible you would feel to really spike like swap ficek?
 Fabia
How would you?
 Fabia
Uhm consider that.
 Sprecher 4
Ann.


Huh.
 Fabia
I.
 Oscar
Guess there's one downside to my history of bikes is that I have.
 Oscar
I have lost a lot of bikes to it being stolen an but it is never cost me more because I've always been given second hand bikes.
 Oscar
Uh huh.
 Oscar


 Oscar
So I would probably lock up the bike as well with two locks because I would hate to come out to see my bike.
 Oscar
Dumb yet again.
 Oscar
At the convenience of still having a bike after you've cycled 40 minutes and you have to cycle 40 minutes to go home would probably still be there.
 Sprecher 4
Me.
 Oscar
But as in maybe knocking it down and stuff.
 Oscar
I think I would probably sooner if it was a grass pitch, probably knock down the swap feeds bike and just lay it on its side rather than use the stand.
 Oscar
Really, yeah, probably.
 Lukas
But that's yes, awesome.
 Oscar
I.
 Oscar
Don't know, I just it's sturdier.
 Oscar
My bike is a bit more fickle.
 Oscar
And I just noted, yeah, yeah, yeah, I know that's what feeds can take it.
 Oscar
And also it like discovered.
 Oscar
Yeah I might be a little worse than my current bike, but my current bike is also like less able to take a hit like that.
 Lukas
You mentioned you mentioned the devil look.
 Lukas
It is literally a very nice question so consistently asking its users to use this double lock.
 Lukas
How, how, how would that make you feel?
 Lukas
A company telling you what to do with the product that you're getting from them?
 Oscar
Part of the contract they could.
 Oscar
They could put it in their contracts.
 Lukas
So like it is part of your responsibility as a as a user, or how?
 Oscar
If you agree to the terms, yeah, it's the well here, but I'm I'm.
 Oscar
Right?
 Oscar
Like
 Oscar
If if they ask me, or do you want to always double lockets and Payless because there's less likelihood of them having to do a find my swap feed thing again?
 Oscar
Miller
 Oscar


 Lukas
Miller
 Oscar
Or pay a little more and then have to unlock it once.
 Oscar
Like that, that would be.
 Oscar
That would make me understand or accept.
 Oscar
The choice, so it's my choice now, but it's in the contract and you your increased pay is probably like if you only have one lock.
 Lukas
Yeah, I see.
 Oscar
Your increased pay is probably going towards them finding stolen bikes, but they have a good system for finding them because they can track them, but it does cost resources to do so.
 Lukas
To actually do it then yeah, yeah, I just have to go nice.
 Fabia
Yep.
 Lukas
That's a that's a really cool idea to have a different mode of looking.
 Lukas
OK love you wanna go about the next one now?
 Fabia
Yeah, sure.
 Fabia
So I already talked about some kind of of yeah being like kind of watching out for their like own bike more than for yourself.
 Fabia
It's just because you think like the surface is more sturdy products, but would you feel guilty if you would damage or lose your swap feeds?
 Fabia
And why?
 Oscar
No, I would treat it as my own product and if I break my own product, I don't usually feel guilty.
 Oscar
I feel a bit disappointed because I now have a broken product.
 Oscar
Ann
 Oscar
So guilty might not be the right word, but I might I would.
 Oscar
I would feel disappointed in myself for having lost said bike or have having damaged it because I probably wouldn't put in the effort to go swap it until I really needed to as well.
 Lukas
Uh huh.
 Sprecher 4
AM.
 Oscar
Yeah, but this is really.
 Lukas
Yep.
 Oscar
Convenient me talking like I could also be out drinking an evening and then maybe not treating it.
 Oscar
I'm being honest, it happened.
 Lukas
Yeah, absolutely right.
 Lukas
I'm just I'm just thinking of how how old our papers are really not considering different aspects in users.
 Lukas
So like what if you like just drunk and don't really careful when you add when something happens?
 Fabia
Uh huh.
 Lukas
You know users are usually that homogeneous Gray mass of people who make the same.
 Lukas
Yeah.
 Lukas
Ann
 Lukas
Sorry, let's I I kind of want to go.
 Lukas
I kinda wanna go about economic concerns because yeah, because you you said that in the responsibility part.
 Fabia
Yeah, yeah.
 Fabia


 Fabia
Yeah.
 Lukas
I think we talked about that.
 Lukas
So there's a subscription model instead of rather buying one time.
 Lukas
How do you?
 Lukas
How do you feel about it being a subscription model?
 Lukas
Rather than.
 Lukas
Applying model.
 Oscar
Fine.
 Oscar
Fine, let's.
 Oscar


 Oscar
Fine, that's yeah I.
 Oscar
I see the convenience in it.
 Lukas
Or is it possible?
 Lukas
Or is possible?
 Oscar
It also means I don't have to have like a wad of cash saved up in case my bike does go missing, which is nice.
 Lukas
Uh, huh, Oh yeah, that's it.
 Oscar
Fam.
 Oscar
But if you are talking about economics, it's still.
 Oscar
I still save more money by not signing up to swap feats currently, so.
 Lukas
Yeah, yeah we go.
 Lukas
It's it goes into economic concerns and frugality.
 Lukas
That's that's the category at the moment.
 Lukas
Uhm?
 Lukas
So on a scale from one to five is where five is the best.
 Lukas
Again or like the Max is, is what feeds presenting a good monetary deal to.
 Lukas
Yeah.
 Oscar
I don't know.
 Oscar
I don't know how.
 Oscar
Much it costs.
 Lukas
OK, how how much do you think it is like?
 Lukas
What would you?
 Oscar
I would expect it to range between 20.
 Oscar
And €40 months.
 Lukas
Yeah, yeah.
 Lukas
I'll be like.
 Oscar
Well, I I I don't know if I'd like 30 year old month 12.
 Lukas
Yeah.
 Oscar
That's like.
 Oscar
It's a lot of money is €200. That's more than I've ever spent on a bike. I think in one go I've never spent more than €100 and then maybe during reparations €50 on a bad year, maybe no 80 year old, probably on a bad year and 20 year old in a Goodyear.
 Lukas
Yeah.
 Fabia
Uh huh.


Yeah.
 Lukas
Yeah.
 Lukas
Yeah, probably I'll be allowed to tell him.
 Lukas
Like how much, how much?
 Lukas
And some models are.
 Fabia
Ah yeah, I'm looking at the price, actually.
 Lukas
But it's well, something I think.
 Sprecher 4
12 year old month? Yeah.
 Sprecher 4
12 year old month.
 Lukas
Yeah, for like students and cheapest model.
 Lukas
And yeah, yeah.


Yeah.




 Lukas
Yeah, OK.
 Oscar
There's no is there on the on the 12 euro model?
 Oscar
Is there any gears?
 Lukas
I don't think so.
 Lukas
It's a.
 Lukas
It's a simple game.
 Oscar
No OK.
 Lukas
Yeah, yeah.
 Lukas
Fixie
 Lukas
So swap pizza has also been used before, right, so?
 Lukas
The same as your second hand bike is there.
 Lukas
What are your views on swipe fees possibly having been used before?
 Lukas
Like if you go to the store and it's like OK, it's not.
 Lukas
It's not a new bike, it's not.
 Oscar
Well, currently my expectation was swap pieces that they take care of the models they have, so it wouldn't be that bad.
 Oscar
They should be OK.
 Lukas
Yeah, I think it's a.
 Lukas
The category extends into like aversion or disgust towards the product being contaminated is that.
 Lukas
Do you think in terms of sort feed speech being contaminated like this?
 Oscar
No, no, I do.
 Oscar
I do understand the idea for some people to say oh I have ownership over my own bike and it's mine.
 Lukas
Yeah.
 Oscar
But I wouldn't feel I wouldn't feel that my bike was contaminated because someone else would have cycled it.
 Oscar
No?
 Lukas
Yeah.
 Lukas
So scale from one to five, again 5 the highest one the lowest.
 Oscar
5 being the most contaminated with the least can like.
 Lukas
The the the most contaminated sorry yeah.
 Oscar
Oh, that I wouldn't 10. I don't know. I don't really mind.
 Lukas
I think I was just scared, yeah?
 Lukas
Alright yeah perfect perfect.
 Lukas
Second to last thing is, is compatibility so.
 Lukas
Would you would you have to adjust your normal cycling lifestyle like your normal cycling?
 Lukas
Style with this work feeds.
 Oscar
Yes, it wouldn't have gears.
 Oscar
I'd probably go for the cheapest version and we have beers.
 Lukas
OK like it would.
 Lukas
It would maybe take longer or whatever, but generally.
 Lukas
Would open rate change much?
 Oscar
Does it?
 Oscar
Does it come with straps on the back of the bike?
 Lukas
I think it doesn't have something on the back of the bike.
 Lukas
It is something at the front, but it doesn't have straps.
 Fabia
On there, no, you can't take someone on the back of your bike.
 Oscar
Yeah, OK, they explicitly made the design such that so that people don't get in the back of the bike.
 Oscar
Also, if you ever on a Nova bike, you're not legally allowed to have someone sitting on the back.
 Oscar
Back
 Oscar


 Oscar
And.
 Oscar


 Oscar
And it's a fine of €250.
 Lukas
250
 Fabia
What book?
 Oscar
Or sorry up to 250 anyway.
 Lukas
OK.
 Oscar
It is.
 Oscar


 Oscar
He I was told this after asking someone who is.
 Oscar
Giving me another bike anyway.
 Lukas
On this whole feed state, transport people on the front tire instead.
 Lukas
Because there's this Becky part like the thing that you have in the back normally is now at the front tire and they just check for people there which actually hard to stir.
 Lukas
That way it's received.
 Oscar
I've seen people do this, yeah, but I I'm pretty sure you're not meant to do that for sure.
 Oscar
It's in your.
 Oscar
Contract to say no, don't do this.
 Lukas
Yeah, pretty much.
 Fabia
I mean, we dutchies carry everyone on our bikes or everything.
 Sprecher 4
Yeah.
 Lukas
It's a certain lifestyle.
 Lukas
That the Dutch employ there so.


Yeah.
 Lukas
I think it's.
 Lukas
I think it's really interesting to to think.
 Lukas
About the lifestyle, that that's what feeds stands for.
 Lukas
You know when you when you say like he was like carrying the other people on the on the front tire.
 Lukas
Even if you know what the Apple interested we're interested in.
 Lukas
What kind of lifestyle you think.
 Lukas
So please actually stand for.
 Oscar
The lifestyle of swap feeds.
 Oscar
Well, I mean, I primarily see students on swap meets.
 Oscar
I.
 Oscar
I do have this feeling of ease of use.
 Oscar
Ease of use.
 Oscar


 Oscar
And I don't really look at someone who's on the swap pizza and say are they know how to fix their bike.
 Oscar
They might, but I I just usually assume they can catch.
 Oscar
This is not to say that it's a bad.
 Oscar
Thing it's just.


Like.
 Oscar
This is a skill I have a bit of value for.
 Lukas
So an introduction of this sentence, or in the first part you said based on what you see, so is that is another.
 Lukas
So empirically there is another reason why you think that.
 Lukas
Or just incorrect.
 Fabia
I did.
 Oscar
Well, it's like it's an assumption on my part.
 Oscar
I mean, it makes me it's like.
 Oscar
I don't know if this person has is able to fix a bike or not, I just assuming he can't, which is or is.
 Oscar
She going to knock.
 Oscar
I like.
 Oscar


 Sprecher 4
And what else I don't know man.
 Sprecher 4
Their lifestyle.
 Lukas
Also doesn't have to be a long elaborate essay on every question, so don't worry about it like right?
 Sprecher 4
No, I don't know.
 Oscar
Yeah, I don't.
 Oscar
I don't know.
 Oscar
Full stop.
 Oscar
I don't know.
 Lukas
I'm.
 Lukas
So fellow students, maybe yeah, other than that area, right?
 Lukas
Why do you think they they use sport feeds?
 Lukas
You can't.
 Oscar
'cause it's a pretty good deal. You just told me as well. I was expecting between 20 and 40 euro. It's 12:50.
 Oscar
It's a good deal, especially its easy way to get a bike you.
 Oscar
It's your bike is going to work and what's nice is we can't blame yourself.
 Oscar
But if you don't have to blame yourself if it's not working you can blame someone else, which is probably nice.
 Lukas
That's an interesting comment for the follow up because I we would like to know how you differ from these people.
 Lukas
Do you?
 Fabia
Uh huh.
 Lukas
Do you blame him playing with yourself when it's broken?
 Oscar
Yeah, if my bike isn't working, it's my fault.
 Lukas
But yeah, how?
 Lukas
How do you differ from them?
 Lukas
Just yeah.
 Sprecher 4
Uhm.
 Oscar
I don't know like I have friends who use these bikes.
 Oscar
That's why I've cycled it myself, it's just.
 Lukas
This is wrong, yeah?
 Sprecher 4
A different means.
 Lukas
This is such a such a nice answer like.
 Lukas
I don't.
 Lukas
Yeah.
 Oscar
Like they have made their decision.
 Oscar
I mean I I differ in like I have decided not to use this bike full stop.
 Oscar
I don't know it might be better, yeah?
 Lukas
Yes, but assuming you would have one now, would you?
 Lukas
So you already talked about attachment to your bike that you plug that?
 Sprecher 4
I am not attached to my bike.
 Lukas
Would you exactly?
 Oscar
OK, maybe no.
 Lukas
Yeah exactly, would you do a swap?
 Lukas
It's.
 Sprecher 4
No.
 Lukas
Yeah, OK.
 Oscar
Probably not, I'd probably, but now that you've now that I've had this whole meeting, I probably would first check out swap feats before I decided to buy my own bike to see what the what the prices really are because.
 Lukas
Interest.
 Fabia
Yes.
 Sprecher 4
Fairly, I could probably get maybe a better bike and pay less than 15 a month.
 Sprecher 4
Uh huh?
 Sprecher 4


 Lukas
Yeah, it's interesting after like talking to these people, we internally have seven interviews and then.
 Lukas
After been to interview, they were like I've never thought so much about swap pieces.
 Fabia
Thanks.
 Lukas
So nice to see like now that I have this interview but we have one one last category which is about image barriers.
 Lukas
So possible negative view of the brand.
 Lukas
The country of origins which is the Netherlands or the innovation category so.
 Lukas
You try to support that greatly already.
 Lukas
So how do you?
 Lukas
How do you feel about this whole piece as?
 Lukas
A brand so.
 Oscar
Uhm, I have this sense of convenience from them.
 Oscar
So when I hear swap feats, I like.
 Oscar
Yeah, they they set up something that's super convenient for people.
 Oscar
Uh huh.
 Oscar
Yeah, I think actually, like if there was. If they did more advertising. About the 12:50 a month slash whatever.
 Lukas
Huh?
 Lukas
Click yes.
 Oscar
Yeah, but I'm I'm annoyed.
 Oscar
At adverts, so I don't know if that.
 Oscar
Would really work, but I can see it.
 Lukas
I can't really imagine you being really a person stalking the advertisement sections of whatever, so.
 Oscar
I I don't know I have.
 Oscar
The convenience is that all that comes to mind when I.
 Oscar
Think of swap treats.
 Oscar
Full stop just.
 Lukas
You already talked about friends.
 Lukas
Who are you thankful kids?
 Lukas
So let's say your your girlfriend, your friends, your family.
 Lukas
Start using swap feeds or like like right would you.
 Lukas
Would you be more inclined?
 Lukas
Then to use it like Dot design, have any effect.
 Sprecher 4
Probably not.
 Oscar
I mean only just only talking about it like this would influence me.


Uh huh?
 Oscar
So if I was talking to my friends about swap feats like this, I would consider it.
 Lukas
I see, yeah.
 Oscar
But that's what happened previously as well when I was trying out my friends like goes like what's I think he did say 12:50 or something. It was crazy. I was like that's that's mad. But then.
 Sprecher 4
Yeah, I pay nothing for my bike now I think I've paid.
 Oscar
€60.00, in part that it also includes a feet bump.
 Lukas
Uh, huh, yeah.
 Sprecher 4
Or a year and a half.
 Lukas
Seek not bad.
 Lukas
I've also needed.
 Lukas
Yeah we have one in our hallway which we can all just collectively use.
 Lukas
That's that's a pretty great deal, I.
 Oscar
Would highly advise getting a feed pump that has a measure on it.
 Sprecher 4
It's exactly that.
 Oscar
If it doesn't have one.
 Lukas
Oh yeah, we have some.
 Oscar
Nice OK here just.
 Lukas
And then all the different adapters for the French or the normal leader.
 Lukas
So this entire interview is kind of hoping around the question of of bike owners.
 Lukas
Tip so like to what extend does a product bike need to be owned today?
 Lukas
So I'll second to last question is actually how do you feel about bike ownership?
 Lukas
As a as a concept?
 Sprecher 4
Erm.
 Sprecher 4
Yeah, I don't know I.
 Oscar
I don't really think about it.
 Fabia
Yeah.
 Oscar
I have I have a.
 Oscar
Bike I have a means to get around.
 Lukas
OK, yeah.
 Oscar
It's it's just another transport method and I prefer I prefer.
 Oscar
I prefer getting around by bike or walking than using public transport.
 Lukas
Uh huh.
 Lukas
But it doesn't.
 Lukas
It does really matter for you.
 Lukas
If I yeah, if I get it right, it doesn't really matter to you whether it's like you, you own it or you get a subscription.
 Lukas
But just that you get around.
 Lukas
That's what most matters.
 Sprecher 4
Well, I mean.
 Oscar
Yeah yeah, but I like if if I had to swap feeds my mentality would be constantly or just get someone else to fix it and I don't really like that mentality.
 Lukas
Uh huh.
 Oscar
That's also something that's ingrained.
 Oscar
This just something my family was always said.
 Oscar
Like if something is broken, fix it yourself.
 Sprecher 4
Uh huh.
 Oscar
But then again, if I was super busy doing loads of other things all the time.
 Oscar
Which I usually am sometimes I don't fix my bike for awhile and like I'll just fix it later.
 Lukas
That's really frustrating.
 Lukas
Yeah, I see.
 Oscar
Yeah, yeah, that's that's one negative thing.
 Lukas
And then.
 Oscar
Yeah, I don't like I don't like that mentality of just swap the bike and get a new one because I think it.
 Lukas
Uh huh.
 Oscar
It also makes you think the same way about other things, but in this case it's perfect because they are literally fixing up the bike and reusing and.
 Oscar
We're cycling in the sense as much as possible.
 Oscar
Thanks.
 Oscar


 Oscar
But yeah, actually, that's in the version I probably have.
 Oscar
I like the idea of going.
 Oscar
I'll fix it.
 Lukas
This is again a very beautiful transition to our last question, which is if there is anything that you would like to add or that has not been discussed or those.
 Lukas
Has always been on your mind about sport feats or a revelation that you had today or.
 Oscar
Yeah, I guess that would be it the.
 Oscar
I like the mentality of going all fix it myself.
 Lukas
I see.
 Oscar
And that's not present in swap feeds.
 Lukas
Well.
 Lukas
We have lost all the questions then so.
 Lukas
I very very much thank you for your time, highly appreciated.
 Lukas
It was a little fun as well.
 Oscar
Good luck coding.
 Lukas
Yeah, good luck reading the report afterwards and then.
 Oscar
Yes.
 Oscar
How how big your reported gotta be?
 Lukas
We don't really know, so if we can estimate that.
 Oscar
Right?
 Fabia
It didn't seem that long.
 Oscar
Yeah, it's like 2500 words with baila.
 Lukas
I'm still searching.
