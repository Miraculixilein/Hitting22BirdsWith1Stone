Speaker 2
Stop recording.
 Speaker 2
OK, ever sign on.
 Speaker 2
Let's open a man.
 Speaker 1
Super.
 Speaker 2
I can blame it for hammer model.
 Speaker 2
This need not opening parameters.
 Speaker 2
Garlic in here.
 Speaker 2
Innovative interview guide ever.
 Speaker 2
OK.
 Speaker 2
Hello who is he brain?
 Speaker 1
Hello.
 Speaker 3
Yeah.
 Speaker 3
Yes.
 Speaker 3


 Speaker 2
Now.
 Speaker 3
Can we proceed in English or yeah?
 Speaker 2
Let's do that this battle right with you mind.
 Speaker 2
That's alright.
 Speaker 2


 Speaker 1
Yes, of course good.
 Speaker 2
All right, yeah.
 Speaker 2
So be Papa sign rules.
 Speaker 2
OK, thank you for taking the time to participate in our interview.


You know, I think.
 Speaker 2
We are doing a research on a swap feats and specifically why some people do not use.
 Speaker 2
Swap feats an we want to research that to see if you look into the details of them.
 Speaker 3
Yeah.
 Speaker 2
Yeah, of the reasons behind that.
 Speaker 2
Why some people are choosing to not participate in this new shiny sharing economy thing?
 Speaker 2
Do we have your permission to record this interview?
 Speaker 1
Of course.
 Speaker 2
Alright, and you have watched the video that I sent you, right?
 Speaker 1
There are 30 second commercial.
 Speaker 2
Yeah yeah, there with them quickly explaining what's swap features.
 Speaker 1
Yes I did.
 Speaker 2
Alright, so.
 Speaker 2
Well then, I suppose we can just start right away.
 Speaker 2
First off, your name is Moran Westrick, of course.
 Speaker 1
Yes I am.
 Speaker 2
Right?
 Speaker 2
Well, how, how old are you exactly?
 Speaker 1
I just turned 30 years old two months ago.
 Speaker 2
Amazing Ann.
 Speaker 2
What is your general occupation?
 Speaker 1
As in my job, yes.
 Speaker 1
I take phone calls for Apple support, so if there's something wrong with your iPhone, iPad, MacBook, iMac, anything, anything like that you call Apple support an you can adjust.
 Speaker 1
Seek for support and my occupation is a senior advisor, so if you're not really getting along with the current advisor, this as far as you can always transfer to a senior advisor and that'll be me.
 Speaker 2
All right?
 Speaker 2
Interesting, thank you.
 Speaker 2
Well, let's turn our attention to biking bicycles.
 Speaker 2
Could you tell me a little bit about your biking habits?
 Speaker 1
Well, since I've lived in an exotic part of town since the last couple of months, my bike got stolen twice.
 Speaker 1
So right now I don't even have a bike.
 Speaker 1
My exact habits would I describe as I purchased a secondhand bike, like twice a year.
 Speaker 1
At a maximum of €100 a year spending on bike.
 Speaker 1
If there's anything wrong with it, I'll be happy to fix it myself, like repair a chain or fix a flat tire.
 Speaker 1
That's not a problem, so I don't really see a professional bike repair service whatsoever in my life.


Uh huh.
 Speaker 2
OK.
 Speaker 1
Actually, I think.
 Speaker 2
OK, and what do you then think of swap feeds?
 Speaker 1
Well.
 Speaker 1
Looking at the commercial, I can understand how a subscription can have some pros and cons. Of course, because the last bike I purchased secondhand cost me €20.
 Speaker 1
I don't know what a regular price is for a swap.
 Speaker 1
Bike subscription, but I can see that if I.
 Speaker 1
If this bike would last.
 Speaker 1
Long enough then of course.
 Speaker 1
I won't be spending so much on a subscription.
 Speaker 2
Yeah.
 Speaker 1
However, if you live in this part of town where a bike could get stolen after a while, then of course I can understand the pros of having a subscription where stolen bike might be replaced.
 Speaker 1
Yes.
 Speaker 1
I guess.
 Speaker 2
Yeah, so how would you then sum up the pros and cons for swap feats?
 Speaker 1
Yeah, I'm not sure.
 Speaker 1
As some.
 Speaker 1
Moving to another place which should be more safe, I plan to wait to purchase a new bike until I'm officially moved.
 Speaker 1
And then I guess I don't really need a subscription on a bike like that, but living in a big city where about could be stolen.
 Speaker 1
Every once in a while.
 Speaker 1
Yeah, of course.
 Speaker 1
For all the students living in the Big city, not being too careful with their bike or not handy enough to fix everything themselves.
 Speaker 1
Of course that there could be lots of pros to the subscription.
 Speaker 1
It depends on how much it will cost monthly I guess.
 Speaker 2
Yeah, so it's a little bit of a convenience in your opinion.
 Speaker 1
Yeah.
 Speaker 2
All right?
 Speaker 2
It's the next question is supposed to break would breakdown now.
 Speaker 2
Would you consider getting a swap fees?
 Speaker 2
But I feel like you already elaborated on that bit pretty well.
 Speaker 1
Well, I'm not really sure about it because.
 Speaker 1
Yeah, the bike looks nice and comfortable.
 Speaker 2
Yeah.
 Speaker 1
Uhm, it would spare me lots of time fixing about myself or worrying about a bike being stolen.
 Speaker 1
Like the commercial said.
 Speaker 1
I would just make a phone call and they come swap it for me so.
 Speaker 2
Yeah.
 Speaker 1
It sounds comfortable.
 Speaker 2
So you might.
 Speaker 1
Yeah, but I I didn't.
 Speaker 1
Didn't do any research about the price, but.
 Speaker 2
Now that's OK.
 Speaker 2
Why then have you not?
 Speaker 2
Why then have you never signed up for a swap feed subscription in the past?
 Speaker 1
I guess because of my habits and the way I was brought up to is always look for a second hand purchases.
 Speaker 1
And if it's if something is broken then try and fix it yourself.
 Speaker 1
And if you don't know how, then.
 Speaker 1
Have a search request on on YouTube and look somebody do it for you and then and then just.
 Speaker 1
Repeat you know, yeah.
 Speaker 2
So it's about a certain.
 Speaker 2
A certain which says about a certain responsibility you would have towards your own biker.
 Speaker 1
Yeah, I guess, but nowadays lots of.
 Speaker 1
Other services also turn into a subscription, which obviously can have their pros and cons.
 Speaker 2
Yeah, yeah.
 Speaker 2
It's only to what extent you think then that swap feeds does or does not fit your own lifestyle.
 Speaker 3
Oh
 Speaker 1
For me right now, that's hard to say because the commercials pretty decent.
 Speaker 1
So I got a really reliable feeling about it.
 Speaker 1
So if I believe every word.
 Speaker 1
Do people in the commercial tell me?
 Speaker 1
There's nothing I have to worry about.
 Speaker 1
OK snowball.
 Speaker 1


 Speaker 1
If my bike is stolen right now, I guess I can make a phone call.
 Speaker 1
Somebody will answer or maybe next thing more tomorrow and then they get me a new bike or they tell me a place to pick up a new bike.
 Speaker 1
Which obviously is awesome.
 Speaker 2
We
 Speaker 1
But I'm.
 Speaker 1
I don't know.
 Speaker 1
Maybe it's a marketing thing.
 Speaker 1
I see the people in the city cycling around on the swap bike, but they never really got to me like this is where you're missing out on not having a swap bike.


Uh huh.
 Speaker 2
Ann
 Speaker 2
Do you know, do you know like where?
 Speaker 2
That where that line is is it just that you were never in there.
 Speaker 2
It.
 Speaker 2
I think I have a.
 Speaker 2
Like
 Speaker 2
Ah.
 Speaker 2
What, yeah?
 Speaker 1
I could put it like this, I I never really saw an advertisement on social media about swap.
 Speaker 1
Like why did they never target me?
 Speaker 2
Yeah.
 Speaker 1
Because I can be in their group of people targeting right?
 Speaker 2
Yeah, So what?
 Speaker 1
And why I never saw the commercial until you.
 Speaker 1
Send it to me, yeah?
 Speaker 1
Send it to me.
 Speaker 2
Yeah, so if if if you have any stereo types associated, like the typical swap feeds user, how would you describe that?
 Speaker 2
Would you do?
 Speaker 2
Like them.
 Speaker 1
I guess the typical swap like user is a student is young is modern an can get used to everything.
 Speaker 1
Turning into such a subscription?
 Speaker 1
So I guess the more old school type people which I was also brought up by and raised by, they don't really like to pay for those things on a monthly basis.
 Speaker 1
They just want to purchase a nice bike.
 Speaker 1
Be very careful with it.
 Speaker 1
Fix it this themselves an.
 Speaker 1
Don't really want to.
 Speaker 1
Pay for it again and again and again, yeah.
 Speaker 2
Yeah.
 Speaker 2


 Speaker 1
But
 Speaker 1
Uhm?
 Speaker 1
Younger generations will be more useful to things turning into a subscription in general.
 Speaker 2
And which of those two would you identify yourself with the most?
 Speaker 1
All right now I'm in the middle.
 Speaker 1
I I could get used to.
 Speaker 1
You know changes like that, but it's not how I'm raised.
 Speaker 2
Yeah.
 Speaker 1
So if I told my father that I got a subscription to a bike.
 Speaker 1
Then
 Speaker 1
He would ask me why would I ever do that?
 Speaker 1
Like if you have this bike for 10 years, being as careful with it as I raised you too.
 Speaker 1
Then you threw away.
 Speaker 1
Quite a lot of money.
 Speaker 2
Yes, but.
 Speaker 1
Just this sense of insurance.
 Speaker 1
Which can make people choose to have a subscription and for me if I look at myself in the last 10 years.
 Speaker 2
Yeah.
 Speaker 1
I guess I've used.
 Speaker 1
At least 20 bucks.
 Speaker 2
That's a bunch.
 Speaker 2
How how do you then feel about bike ownership as opposed to a subscription to a bike?
 Speaker 1
I guess in the last 10 years.
 Speaker 1
It would make it would spare me a lot of headache about damn well my where did my bike go.
 Speaker 1
Sometimes in the station bike parking.
 Speaker 1
I just did not put it away in the right way so you lose it.
 Speaker 1
You have to pick it up somewhere out of town and you need to pay some expenses for that because you did not.
 Speaker 1
Stick to the rules and all that so.
 Speaker 1
If I would have a swap bike, and even when a station you know so some station.
 Speaker 1
Bike parking lot employee would take my bike and swap back would swap it for Maine.
 Speaker 1
Oh man, that would be so much easier.
 Speaker 2
Yeah.
 Speaker 2
Yeah, so bike ownership wouldn't necessarily be necessary.
 Speaker 2


 Speaker 1
No, not really.
 Speaker 1
It's not like look at my cool bike that I actually own.
 Speaker 2
Yeah.
 Speaker 1
I don't.
 Speaker 1
I don't really feel like when you buy a car or something.
 Speaker 2
Yeah, so then how do you?
 Speaker 2
That
 Speaker 2


 Speaker 2
How do you feel about swap feeds as a brand?


So fast.
 Speaker 1
Sorry.
 Speaker 2
How do you then feel about swap feats as like a brand?
 Speaker 1
Oh, I don't feel too much about it.
 Speaker 1
I would say that if I had this swap bike subscription then.
 Speaker 1
I would just never had to stress about it whatsoever.
 Speaker 1
Because I'm paying every month for it.
 Speaker 1
So if there's anything wrong I wouldn't even start thinking about doing something else than calling through the company.
 Speaker 1
Share my problem.
 Speaker 1
And tell him to go fix it.
 Speaker 2
Yeah.
 Speaker 2


 Speaker 1
Yeah, and it's kind of like.
 Speaker 1
It also has to do do something with my job as I'm doing right now, because if you have an Apple device and you paid lots of money for it and you choose to have this insurance with it, you also.
 Speaker 1
It.
 Speaker 1


 Speaker 1
Don't think any further than calling Apple and just tell me to fix your problem.
 Speaker 1
As soon as I can, I'll do it, obviously.
 Speaker 1
So in that way I would kind of feel the same about this brand.
 Speaker 1
It's like I have a top class bike with top class surface and I'm not going to expect any less of it.
 Speaker 2
All right?
 Speaker 2
Uhm?
 Speaker 2
That actually we did discuss.
 Speaker 2
Let's turn our attention and attention to like the the complexity of the.


Yeah.
 Speaker 2
Actually, actually let's let's talk about the reliability of the bike.
 Speaker 2
What do you think about swap features, reliability and performance?
 Speaker 1
It looks like a very modern.
 Speaker 1
Reliable.
 Speaker 1
Product, if that's what you mean.
 Speaker 2
Yeah.
 Speaker 2
Do you think that to what extent do you think that swap fries would provide you with a good, safe, and or sturdy product?
 Speaker 1
I guess 100%.
 Speaker 1
I guess if.
 Speaker 1
If you offer me this subscription to a good product, I can't expect anything less of it than 100%. Of course, you can get.
 Speaker 1
A flat tire.
 Speaker 2
Uh huh.
 Speaker 1
Cycling to through glass on the on.
 Speaker 1
On the cycle path of course, same goes for an iPhone.
 Speaker 1
If you drop it without a protection case, of course there's going to be damage, but.
 Speaker 2
Yeah.
 Speaker 1
The product, if you treat it carefully, it has to work for 100% at all time and.
 Speaker 3
All right?
 Speaker 1
I've seen people parking their swap bugs in front of me.
 Speaker 1
There's a double lock situation.
 Speaker 1
And it just looks secure and the bike looks comfortable.
 Speaker 1
It looks good actually.
 Speaker 1
It just looks like D.
 Speaker 1
Number one modern bike.
 Speaker 1
For young people to subscribe to, actually.
 Speaker 2
And compared to a secondhand bike, which would be better?
 Speaker 3
Well.
 Speaker 1
Yes, yes, I guess it.
 Speaker 1
It don't.
 Speaker 1
It doesn't always have to be better, because if let's just say I consider myself as an excellent secondhand bike shopper.


Uh huh.
 Speaker 1
I know where to pay attention to, but.
 Speaker 1
There's all.
 Speaker 1
There's also some experience you need to.
 Speaker 1
Need to gather because.
 Speaker 1
You can also buy a bike that looks very nice and pay.
 Speaker 1
Lots of money for it, even though it's secondhand and don't know what to pay attention for.
 Speaker 1
And after a week you need to fix it anyway.
 Speaker 1
So.
 Speaker 1
With a secondhand bike, if you know what you're doing, it can save you a lot of money.
 Speaker 1
Right?
 Speaker 1
But then you also need to be careful it's it depends on the place where you live.
 Speaker 1
Like I've been living here for not even 12 months and my bike got stolen twice on a double lock so.
 Speaker 1
In in, in my situation, for the last 10 years, swap by subscription would have been a very good idea, all right.
 Speaker 2
All right?
 Speaker 2


 Speaker 2
To what extent do you then trust the service of swap feats to supply in time with a replacement?
 Speaker 1
I can't really say.
 Speaker 1
Very much about it because I have no experience with that.
 Speaker 1
I can understand that if you're a customer with a subscription by the time you have a minor or major inconvenience that then you discover what surface you're really going to get like.
 Speaker 1
Also, your Internet provider, which put you on hold for.
 Speaker 1
Half an hour or you know.
 Speaker 1
Supporting a customer is not just that easy.
 Speaker 1
Well, I.
 Speaker 1
I'm willing to believe that if there's enough staff.
 Speaker 1
And Anhan their intention is good.
 Speaker 1
They're not robots hiding behind procedures then.
 Speaker 1
Yeah, I'm I'm willing to trust a proper surface, of course.
 Speaker 2
All right?
 Speaker 2
Can you could you tell me a bit about how complicated you think it would be to get a swap feeds?
 Speaker 1
I don't believe it's very.
 Speaker 1
Complicated, I wouldn't say I have my subscription fixed in 5 minutes right now, but I would just Google the brand an I would expect that the first thing they offer is to welcome me as a new customer.
 Speaker 1
Yeah, that's what I would do if I was CEO of the company.
 Speaker 2
Would be smart.
 Speaker 2
I, let's move to OK, so there's a.
 Speaker 2
There's an interesting thing an.
 Speaker 2
It talks about in the literature about contamination being an issue in certain sharing economies.
 Speaker 2
And we'd like to ask what your views are on using a swap feeds, given the fact that it has possibly been used before by someone else.
 Speaker 1
I don't mind.
 Speaker 1
I I buy secondhand bikes.
 Speaker 2
Yeah, I think I see your point.
 Speaker 1
Well, there's another touch to it as it it it feels more.
 Speaker 1
Sustainable, so if I understand you correctly, we have a situation where my bike is stolen.
 Speaker 1
And they swapped my bike for a new one and this stolen bike.
 Speaker 1
Got recovered.
 Speaker 1
And they fixed it up.
 Speaker 1
It's ready to use again.
 Speaker 1
Then why not swap this bike for another bike that needs to be repaired?
 Speaker 3
Yeah.
 Speaker 1
I think if we can all agree.
 Speaker 1
So.
 Speaker 1
So that idea.
 Speaker 1
Then it saves us lots of swap bike recycling processes so.
 Speaker 1
Sure, why not?
 Speaker 2
All right, Anne, would you?
 Speaker 2
Given that you now own your own bikes and you already mentioned that.
 Speaker 2
And that you are adept at fixing them yourself?
 Speaker 2
Would you how responsible would you feel for a least back compared to a bike you own?


OK.
 Speaker 1
That's that's what you're going to get when you offer.
 Speaker 1
At least by situation, I'm going to feel way less responsible for it.
 Speaker 1
I can understand some rules like you, you can't just.
 Speaker 1
Tell your bike is stolen when you.
 Speaker 1
Did even locked it so I can understand an agreement like just handing your keys so we know that.
 Speaker 1
That you did something responsible with it, but.
 Speaker 1
I wouldn't mind barking it anywhere, and if you tell me if you would threaten me like I will go to your house and steal your bike.
 Speaker 1
I I will be like whatever I I'm subscribed to a bike so I don't really own this bike right here.
 Speaker 2
Uh huh.
 Speaker 1
I have a company backing me up giving me a bike when I need one.
 Speaker 1
So if if.
 Speaker 1
If that idea would be confirmed without too much rules to it whatsoever, then yes, you're gonna get customers I get.
 Speaker 1
I guess that are treating the bike less responsibly because.
 Speaker 1
What if I get a flat tire?
 Speaker 1
I'm not even gonna fix it myself.
 Speaker 1
I'm paying for you to swap it for me.
 Speaker 1
So there's going to be more swapping than necessary, I think.
 Speaker 2
Alright, and swap fees also asks its users to double lock their bikes and if I am not mistaken there's also an extra fee.
 Speaker 2
If your bike gets stolen and you don't return the keys or something.
 Speaker 2
In any case, repairs are significantly cheaper than.
 Speaker 2
Man.
 Speaker 1
That sounds fair enough.
 Speaker 2
Yeah, how do you feel about a company telling you what to do with your own bike?
 Speaker 1
I don't really feel like they're telling me what to do because as a customer, one way or another you have a certain responsibility.
 Speaker 1
I guess the most important thing is to help me.
 Speaker 1
Knowing what I'm responsible for, if I do another compare to Apple situation where you have an extra Apple Care plus agreement if you drop your brand new iPads on the train track which will never going to recover.
 Speaker 1
It won't be replaced because we want the original product back.
 Speaker 1
It's in the rules.
 Speaker 1
You agree with that.
 Speaker 1
People are tend to accept the rules without reading them.
 Speaker 1
Ann
 Speaker 1
A company is tended to.
 Speaker 1
Have the rules offered in really small details, making it not clear enough, and that's where customer dissatisfaction starts, yeah?
 Speaker 2
Yeah.
 Speaker 2


 Speaker 1
So if.
 Speaker 1
If I think that I I don't need to have any responsible for my bike.
 Speaker 1
I don't even lock it because if you steal it, I just called to the swap bike company get me a new bike and then they start explaining me things I didn't know before.
 Speaker 1
That's where I get unhappy.
 Speaker 1
But
 Speaker 1
If you.
 Speaker 1
Sell me this first brand new swap bike.
 Speaker 1
Congratulate me with my new super modern product.
 Speaker 1
Just take your time and explain me.
 Speaker 1
What to do?
 Speaker 1
Don't have to be very complicated, but have your customers know.
 Speaker 1
What they signed up for?
 Speaker 2
Alright, interesting, thank you.
 Speaker 2
Yeah, March it do you have any questions left?
 Speaker 3
Well, it is very nice to hear such a different point of view.
 Speaker 3
Let's say that so the modern part is very new to me, so that that's really nice.
 Speaker 3
Alright, so.
 Speaker 3
We did touch upon all the.
 Speaker 3
Older barriers I would say.
 Speaker 2
I think so, yeah.
 Speaker 2
So then, yeah, I was seeing that the the time of the interview is nearing to an end.
 Speaker 2
Is there anything that you would still like to add which we did not discuss before?
 Speaker 3
Yeah.
 Speaker 1
No, can't really think of anything.
 Speaker 2
All right?
 Speaker 2
Yeah, it's still interesting to see whether you will actually adopt A swap fix in the future or not.
 Speaker 3
Engine project.
 Speaker 1
Not, I'm not 100% sure about it. I have to take a look at the price maybe.
 Speaker 3
Well, it is. I thought there are different subscriptions, but the the cheapest version with just one gear is I think around €15 a month so.
 Speaker 3
1212 OK, yeah. So well with with your habit of.
 Speaker 2
12
 Speaker 2


 Speaker 3
Of knowing how to deal with bikes.
 Speaker 3
Could be more expensive, but there are quite a few perks of course.
 Speaker 3
But well just how you view them so.
 Speaker 2
Yeah, do you think that that would present a good monetary deal?
 Speaker 2
But I.
 Speaker 1
Not yet, I'm not really sure about it yet, but yeah, I'm also considering that I'm moving out of this part of town, so I already figured that I don't really necessarily need a bike right now because I'm working from home.


Yeah.
 Speaker 1
Why not buy a bike when you can install it?
 Speaker 1
Somewhere safe, yeah yeah yeah an yeah if I.
 Speaker 1
If I can find.
 Speaker 1
A bike comparing equality to a swap bike.
 Speaker 1
Then €50, being a little more careful with it, fixing it myself when I need to will save me. Of course lots of.
 Speaker 1
Money at.
 Speaker 1
Step subscribe
 Speaker 3
Yeah, yeah.
 Speaker 1
But I I do think that that's what bike should target their audience in.
 Speaker 1
In in the bigger cities, where where bike thieves are more active.
 Speaker 3
Yeah, and maintenance is hard if you always have to stall it outside or not in a garage or something.
 Speaker 1
Actually, there's lots of class on the flow on the on the cycling press here, so if you not really good at fixing a flat tire, it will be very easy to just hop to the swap by.
 Speaker 1
At your local swap bike company and then just.
 Speaker 1
Swap it right away.
 Speaker 3
For sure, yeah you.
 Speaker 3
Make this part is a very good deal, very smart.
 Speaker 1
Yeah, and I think you really should target the audience who are really into this.
 Speaker 1
Not stressing about this maintenance, yeah?
 Speaker 1
But of course.
 Speaker 3
For sure.
 Speaker 1
Should you should.
 Speaker 1
Have your customer know what they exactly sign up for instead of keep thinking I don't even going to lock that for sure.
 Speaker 3
Yeah, yeah.
 Speaker 1
I'm gonna swap it if it gets stolen.
 Speaker 1
You know that that that's where the where the dissatisfaction from your customers can start when they don't have the right information.
 Speaker 1
And you have to look it up all in the small details yourself.
 Speaker 3
Yeah.
 Speaker 1
People don't do that.
 Speaker 1
No, not even with a very expensive phone or computer.
 Speaker 1
They just click accept and then think if there's something wrong.
 Speaker 1
The company will fix it for me and that's why I'm spending half of my days explaining procedures to unhappy customers, reading them their own responsibilities, and I don't think you want that.
 Speaker 3
No.
 Speaker 3
Now.
 Speaker 3


 Speaker 2
That it's out of all things sustainable.
 Speaker 2
This is not one of them.
 Speaker 3
Yeah.
 Speaker 2
All right?
 Speaker 2
I think that concludes our interviews, ma'am, thank you very much for your for your time and your insights.
 Speaker 1
That'll be welcome.
 Speaker 2
Could we contact you if we maybe may need clarification on some of your answers?
 Speaker 1
Yes, of course.
 Speaker 2
All right, Anne?
 Speaker 2
Yeah with that goodnight Ann, you can leave the call.
 Speaker 1
Likewise, thank you very much.
 Speaker 2
Yes.
 Speaker 1
Yeah, good luck on the project.
 Speaker 2
Thank you adding us.
 Speaker 1
Bye.


Yeah.
 Speaker 3
You recorded everything right.
 Speaker 2
Yeah, make it.
 Speaker 2
Yeah, let's continue in English.


OK.
 Speaker 2
I mean, that makes that I think that does actually make it easier for the program to interpret it, although yeah.
 Speaker 3
Yeah, I imagine.
 Speaker 2
No, I think it could do Dutch, but English is easier, more fine tuned and it can definitely not deal with two languages at the same time.
 Speaker 2
Come.
 Speaker 2
Do we, yeah, like any remarks, did we learn anything new?
 Speaker 2
Should we just some questions?
 Speaker 2
Do we get enough answers?
 Speaker 3
Every a lot elaborates on a lot of things, and the modern part was very interesting to me and a stolen Part 2 because I hadn't thought of that before like that, I think.
 Speaker 2
Yeah.
 Speaker 2
Yeah.
 Speaker 2
It's something that.
 Speaker 2
A listener in the interview I did with Fleur also said when I asked like about the stereotypical swap for each user.
 Speaker 2
And like it feels like there's this image around swap which users that all the new, the newest newest generation easily like gullibly just eats up this new sharing model convenience and that the previous generation would oppose that.
 Speaker 2
And that a lot of people here are still in the middle.
 Speaker 2
And I felt that in my brain as well, like I've been brought, he mentioned he's been brought up and he knows how to fix a bike and he thinks that.
 Speaker 2
I mean, it's cheaper to own a bike and then to learn how to fix it.
 Speaker 2
So why not do that?
 Speaker 2
It's better for your wallet this.
 Speaker 2
Well, and it it it.
 Speaker 2
All of those things are like a lot of.
 Speaker 2
I want to say yeah, like parents, generation habits, values.


Yeah.
 Speaker 3
Millimeter, that's also what you said, yeah?
 Speaker 3
At.
 Speaker 3


 Speaker 2
Yeah, and bike ownership is not necessarily the issue, it's more.
 Speaker 3
No.
 Speaker 2
It's more the idea that you should not pay for something that you can get for cheaper an A little bit of Labor from yourself.


Yes.
 Speaker 3
Yes, yeah for sure.
 Speaker 2
Yeah.
 Speaker 2
An with all of the other things I got the feeling that he really because he didn't identify himself as like part of the target group for swap keys.
 Speaker 2
He was also never drawn towards it and now that he's reading the actual pros and cons likes, I mean this is not.
 Speaker 3
Things, yeah, yeah, exactly OK, it's not bad, no, but yeah, it's very interesting that he didn't came in contact that much with it.
 Speaker 2
This is not that bad.
 Speaker 2
Yeah.
 Speaker 3
In comparison to some of the other Target Group who say like all my friends have it at the University, you see them everywhere.
 Speaker 3
I know exactly what they give, what their pros and cons are, but I just don't want it and he was.


Yeah.
 Speaker 2
Yeah, that that's it's.
 Speaker 3
Not that well.
 Speaker 2
Yeah, it's also 'cause he's 30 and he turned 32 months ago and I I think I forgot to congratulate him, which is very bad.
 Speaker 3
Yeah, but maybe he was just before the wave of swap fees because that's three years.
 Speaker 2
Right there.
 Speaker 2
Yeah, no, he was.
 Speaker 2
He was my neighbor for a long while and we've been good friends ever since.


Yes.
 Speaker 2
But he moved.
 Speaker 2
At some point.
 Speaker 2
Although I think swap, which was around when he was still living in the student housing, eventually you moved, but.
 Speaker 3
OK.
 Speaker 2
It he was definitely like in terms of generations in the students.
 Speaker 2
He was definitely the previous generation student and then I was the next and then the one after me really got down.
 Speaker 2
That's what feeds wave.
 Speaker 2
And because it's two generations apart from him.


Yeah.
 Speaker 2
It was always like those are the young people in the home.
 Speaker 3
I don't know.
 Speaker 3
Yeah.
 Speaker 2
I mean I'm I'm I'm 25, plus already I'm not going to talk to all the 18 year old boys on the street.
 Speaker 3
Yeah, I also so well in my personal experience.
 Speaker 3
I also saw that the younger students first year who just came to a town, mostly the first three months before they settled.
 Speaker 3
Inch thought?
 Speaker 3
Ah, what the heck.
 Speaker 3
I take a swab feeds to seeds.
 Speaker 3
Easy for now and if I get a.
 Speaker 3
Different bike that's better than we see about that, but.
 Speaker 3
Yeah.
 Speaker 3


 Speaker 3
That's easy to step into now, yeah, 2 seconds.
 Speaker 2
Yeah.
 Speaker 2
I also think that because one of our questions is be Papa or did we remove that one?
 Speaker 2
If your friends and family started using swap fees, yeah, it's an image barriers.


Yeah.


Yes.
 Speaker 2
Would you be more inclined to use it?
 Speaker 2
I think that the answer to that question will actually always be yes.
 Speaker 2
But no one will say yes to that question because everyone's already made a decision.
 Speaker 3
Yeah.
 Speaker 3
Yeah, yeah, and that's a bit of a.
 Speaker 3
Uhm, yeah, and an influence that you don't recognize until it's already done.
 Speaker 2
Yeah, yeah, but definitely.
 Speaker 3
Well, because he said, like yeah, my father raised me to do my own things with my bicycle.
 Speaker 3
So he is influenced.
 Speaker 3
He already says that, but for the opposite.
 Speaker 2
Yeah.
 Speaker 3
Of that so.
 Speaker 2
Yeah, it's it's the thing in between two different identities.
 Speaker 2
Own your own bike.
 Speaker 2
Fix it yourself.
 Speaker 2
**** it.
 Speaker 2
This is the wave of sustainability and then responsibility issues.
 Speaker 3
Yeah, very interesting.
 Speaker 2
It's yeah, it's it's a completely different way of.
 Speaker 2
It's just, it's just viewing an just a completely different set of habits concerning bike biking.
 Speaker 3
Yeah.
 Speaker 2
An having a bicycle.
 Speaker 3
Uh huh.
 Speaker 2
And it it it, it needs transition and we are.
 Speaker 2
Yeah.
 Speaker 2


 Speaker 2
It feels like we're studying the transition.
 Speaker 3
For sure, yeah, it's really nice.
 Speaker 2
All right?
 Speaker 3
It's really nice to really put the questions to a person that you don't know, so.
 Speaker 2
Yeah, yeah.
 Speaker 2
Yeah, all right.
 Speaker 2
Yeah.
 Speaker 2


 Speaker 3
Well, I will do two more tomorrow.
 Speaker 3
How's the the software?
 Speaker 3
Is that difficult to you?
 Speaker 2
Oh BS.
 Speaker 2
No, it's not difficult at all.
 Speaker 2
I think I can even share my screen at this point and I could show you this share content and then oh, BS is going to flip because then I think we're going to have that dristan that most affect.
 Speaker 3
Oh nice.
 Speaker 3
Yeah.
 Speaker 3
Yeah yeah that you have like, no, it's it's.
 Speaker 2
Yeah.
 Speaker 2

OK.
 Speaker 2

 Speaker 3
Oh, you also record the screen.
 Speaker 2

 Speaker 3
Yeah, also the lights pillow.
 Speaker 2
Yeah, OK.
 Speaker 2


 Speaker 2
OK.
 Speaker 2
Yeah, So what I did oh BS Oh my curse Oh my cursing.
 Speaker 2
He's not there from the other screen.
 Speaker 3
Yeah.
 Speaker 2
And so I've got 2 audio track. In OBS you can really just pick each audio track and pitch the epic video thing, and there's a lot of specifics and a lot of options. What I did was I I'm recording the desktop audio right now.
 Speaker 3
Yeah.
 Speaker 2
An if if if you want to make sure that's on the right device which was not in my case, you can go and press properties here and then.
 Speaker 2
Here you can select your device.
 Speaker 2
And I've got that set to loudspeaker, so that's that's my ears and the one on the below is my Mike Slash Oaks and that's my microphone, so I have two audio tracks once for this, one for this one an I'm wearing a headset because they won't interfere with each other.


Yes.
 Speaker 2
If I yeah if I would have done it via my computer it will be able to record, but it will also record all the.
 Speaker 3
Hello.
 Speaker 2
Cool.
 Speaker 3
That's that's beautiful.
 Speaker 2
Yeah, and I pressed here on window capture an then like in the bar here you get a drop down in here you can select your window and I selected the one that's of course the meeting window.
 Speaker 2
And then here's a button to stop and start recording.
 Speaker 3
No.
 Speaker 2
And is somewhere it says where it gets saved and in my case that's in videos.
 Speaker 2
So I'm going to stop this recording.
