 Emile
Hallo. Goeie dag iedereen.
 Marijn
Hallo.
 Maartje
Shall we proceed in English or?
 Emile
Yeah, let's do that. Is that alright with you Marijn?
 Marijn
Yes, of course.
 Emile
Good. All right, uhhh. So... beep bap bap... assign roles... OK, thank you for taking the time to participate in our interview. We are doing a research on a Swapfiets, and specifically why some people do not use Swapfiets. And we want to research that to look into the details of uh, yeah, of the reasons behind that, why some people are choosing to not participate in this new shiny sharing economy thing. Do we have your permission to record this interview?
 Marijn
Of course.
 Emile
Alright, and you have watched the video that I sent you, right?
 Marijn
There 30 second commercial? Yes I did.
 Emile
Yeah yeah, with them quickly explaining what Swapfiets is. Alright, uhh. Well then, I suppose we can just start right away. First off, your name is Marijn Westerik, of course.
 Marijn
Haha, yes.
 Emile
How old are you exactly?
 Marijn
I just turned 30 years old two months ago.
 Emile
Amazing and what is your general occupation?
 Marijn
As in my job? I take phone calls for Apple support, so if there's something wrong with your iPhone, iPad, MacBook, iMac, anything like that you call Apple support and you kinda just... seek for support. And my occupation is a senior advisor, so if you're not really getting along with the current advisor, this advisor can always transfer to a senior advisor and that'll be me.

 Emile
All right. Interesting, thank you. Well, let's turn our attention to biking bicycles. Could you tell me a little bit about your biking habits?
 Marijn
Well, since I've lived in an exotic part of town since the last couple of months, my bike got stolen twice. So right now I don't even have a bike. My exact habits would I describe as: I purchase a secondhand bike, like, twice a year, at a maximum of €100 a year spending on bikes. If there's anything wrong with it, I'll be happy to fix it myself, like, repair a chain or fix a flat tire, that's not a problem. So I don't really see a professional bike repair service whatsoever in my life, actually, I think.
 Emile
OK, and what do you then think of Swapfiets?
 Marijn
Well... Looking at the commercial, I can understand how a subscription can have some pros... and cons, of course. Because the last bike I purchased secondhand cost me €20, I don't know what a regular price is for a Swapfiets subscription, but I can see that if this bike would last long enough then, of course, I won't be spending so much on a subscription.
 Emile
Yeah.
 Marijn
However, if you live in this part of town where a bike could get stolen after a while, then of course I can understand the pros of having a subscription where stolen bike might be replaced, I guess.
 
 Emile
Yeah, so how would you then sum up the pros and cons for Swapfiets?
 Marijn
Yeah, I'm not sure. As I'm moving to another place which should be more safe, I plan to wait to purchase a new bike until I'm officially moved. And then I guess I don't really need a subscription on a bike like that, but living in a big city where a bike could be stolen every once in a while... Yeah, of course. For all the students living in the Big city, not being too careful with their bike or not handy enough to fix everything themselves. Of course that there could be lots of pros to the subscription. It depends on how much it will cost monthly I guess.
 Emile
Yeah, so it's a little bit of a convenience in your opinion.
 Marijn
Yeah.
 Emile
All right. The next question is: suppose your bike would break down now, would you consider getting a Swapfiets? But I feel like you already elaborated on that bit pretty well.
 Marijn
Well, I'm not really sure about it. Because the bike looks nice and comfortable. Uhm, it would spare me lots of time fixing a bike myself, or worrying about a bike being stolen. Like the commercial said, I would just make a phone call and they come swap it for me so it sounds comfortable.
 Emile
So you might.
 Marijn
Yeah, but I didn't do any research about the price, but...

 Emile
No, that's OK. Why then have you never signed up for a Swapfiets subscription in the past?
 Marijn
I guess because of my habits. The way I was brought up is to always look for second hand purchases, and if something is broken then try and fix it yourself. And if you don't know how, then have a search on YouTube and look for somebody who can show it to you, and then just repeat that, you know?
 Emile
So it's about a certain... would you say it's about a certain responsibility you would have towards your own bike?
 Marijn
Yeah, I guess. But nowadays lots of other services also turn into a subscription. Which obviously can have their pros and cons.

 Emile
Yeah, yeah. Tell me to what extent you think then that Swapfiets does or does not fit your own lifestyle.
 Marijn
For me right now, that's hard to say because the commercial is pretty decent. So I got a really reliable feeling about it. So if I believe every word the people in the commercial tell me, there's nothing I have to worry about. If my bike would get stolen right now, I guess I can make a phone call. Somebody will answer, or maybe next thing more tomorrow, and then they get me a new bike or they point me towards a place where I can pick up a new bike. Which obviously is awesome. But uhm... I don't know. Maybe it's a marketing thing. I see the people in the city cycling around on the Swapfiets, but they never really got to me. Like, this is where you're missing out on not having a Swapfiets.
 Emile
And... Do you know, do you know where that line is? Is it just that you were never in their... uhh... [forgetting the word "doelgroep" in English]
 Marijn
I could put it like this, I never really saw an advertisement on social media about Swapfiets. Why did they never target me? Because I can be in their "group of people targeting" right? [= Target Group] And I never saw the commercial until you sent it to me.

 Emile
Yeah, so if you have any stereo types associated, like the typical Swapfiets-user, how would you describe that?
 Marijn
I guess the typical Swapfiets-user is a student is young, is modern, and can get used to everything turning into such a subscription. So I guess the more old school type people, which I was also brought up by and raised by, they don't really like to pay for those things on a monthly basis. They just want to purchase a nice bike, be very careful with it, fix it this themselves and don't really want to pay for it again and again and again.
 Emile
Yeah.
 Marijn
But younger generations will be more used to things turning into a subscription in general.
 Emile
And which of those two would you identify yourself with the most?
 Marijn
All right, now I'm in the middle. I could get used to, you know, changes like that, but it's not how I'm raised.
 Emile
Yeah.
 Marijn
So if I told my father that I got a subscription to a bike, then he would ask me why would I ever do that? Like, if you have this bike for 10 years, being as careful with it as I raised you too. Then you threw away quite a lot of money. But just this sense of insurance can make people choose to have a subscription. And for me, if I look at myself in the last 10 years, I guess I've used at least 20 bikes.

 Emile
That's a bunch. How do you then feel about bike ownership as opposed to a subscription to a bike?
 Marijn
I guess, in the last 10 years, it would have spared me a lot of headache about "damn where did my bike go?" Sometimes in the station bike parking, I just did not put it away in the right way, so you lose it. You have to then pick it up somewhere out of town, and you need to pay some expenses for that, because you did not stick to the rules and all that. So, if I would have a Swapfiets, and even when a station.. you know, some station-bike-parking-lot employee would take my bike and Swapfiets would swap it for me.. Oh man, that would be so much easier.
 Emile
Yeah, so bike ownership wouldn't necessarily be, uh, necessary.
 Marijn
No, not really. It's not like look at my cool bike that I actually own. I don't really feel like when you buy a car, or something.

 Emile
Yeah, so then how do you feel about Swapfiets as a brand?
 Marijn
Oof. I don't feel too much about it. I would say that if I had this Swapfiets subscription then I would just never had to stress about it whatsoever. Because I'm paying every month for it. So if there's anything wrong I wouldn't even start thinking about doing something else than calling the company, share my problem, and tell them to go fix it.
 Emile
Yeah.
 Marijn
It's kind of like. It also has something to do with my job which I'm doing right now. Because if you have an Apple device and you paid lots of money for it and you choose to have this insurance with it, you also don't think any further than calling Apple and just tell me to fix your problem, as soon as I can. I'll do it, obviously. So in that way I would kind of feel the same about this brand. It's like I have a top class bike with top class surface and I'm not going to expect any less of it.

 Emile
All right. Let's turn our attention and attention to like, the the complexity of the uhm... Actually, let's talk about the reliability of the bike. What do you think about Swapfiets' reliability and performance?
 Marijn
It looks like a very modern, reliable product, if that's what you mean.
 Emile
To what extent do you think that Swapfiets would provide you with a good, safe, and or sturdy product?
 Marijn
I guess 100%. I guess if you offer me this subscription to a good product, I can't expect anything less of it than 100%. Of course, you can get a flat tire, cycling through glass on the on the cycle path of course. Same goes for an iPhone, if you drop it without a protection case, of course there's going to be damage, but the product, if you treat it carefully, it has to work for 100% at all time. I've seen people parking their Swapfiets in front of me. There's a double lock situation, and it just looks secure and the bike looks comfortable. It looks good actually, it just looks like The #1 modern bike for young people to subscribe to, actually.
 Emile
And compared to a secondhand bike, which would be better?
 Marijn
Well... Yes, yes, I guess it... it doesn't always have to be better, because if... Let's just say I consider myself an excellent secondhand bike shopper, I know where to pay attention to. But there's also some experience you need to gather, because you can also buy a bike that looks very nice and pay lots of money for it, even though it's secondhand and don't know what to pay attention to, and after a week you need to fix it anyway. So, with a secondhand bike, if you know what you're doing, it can save you a lot of money. But then you also need to be careful... it depends on the place where you live, like, I've been living here for not even 12 months and my bike got stolen twice on a double lock. So, in my situation, for the last 10 years, Swapfiets subscription would have been a very good idea.

 Emile
All right. To what extent do you then trust the service of Swapfiets to supply in time with a replacement?
 Marijn
I can't really say very much about it because I have no experience with that. I can understand that if you're a customer with a subscription, by the time you have a minor or major inconvenience that then you discover what service you're really going to get. Like, also your Internet provider, which puts you on hold for half an hour or, you know, supporting a customer is not just that easy. I'm willing to believe that if there's enough staff, and their intention is good, they're not robots hiding behind procedures, then yeah, I'm willing to trust a proper service, of course.

 Emile
All right. Could you tell me a bit about how complicated you think it would be to get a Swapfiets?
 Marijn
I don't believe it's very complicated. I wouldn't say I have my subscription fixed in 5 minutes right now, but I would just Google the brand an I would expect that the first thing they offer is to welcome me as a new customer. Yeah, that's what I would do if I was CEO of the company.

 Emile
Would be smart. Let's move to... OK, so there's an interesting thing being talked about in the literature, about contamination being an issue in certain sharing economies. And we'd like to ask what your views are on using a Swapfiets, given the fact that it has possibly been used before by someone else.
 Marijn
I don't mind. I buy secondhand bikes, hahaha.
 Emile
Yeah, I think I see your point.
 Marijn
Well, there's another touch to it, as it feels more sustainable. So if I understand you correctly, we have a situation where my bike is stolen, they swapped my bike for a new one and this stolen bike got recovered and they fixed it up, it's ready to use again. Then why not swap this bike for another bike that needs to be repaired?
 Emile
Yeah.
 Marijn
I think if we can all agree to that idea, then it saves us lots of Swapfiets recycling processes. So, sure, why not?

 Emile
All right, and, given that you now own your own bikes and you already mentioned that, and that you are adept at fixing them yourself. How responsible would you feel for a leased bike, compared to a bike you own?
 Marijn
That's what you're going to get when you offer a leased bike situation, I'm going to feel way less responsible for it. I can understand some rules, like, you can't just say your bike is stolen when you didn't even lock it. So, I can understand an agreement like "just hand in your keys so we know that you did SOMEthing responsible with it". But I wouldn't mind parking it anywhere. And if you tell me if you would threaten me like I will go to your house and steal your bike, I will be like "whatever haha, I'm subscribed to a bike". So I don't really own this bike right here, I have a company backing me up giving me a bike when I need one. If that idea would be confirmed without too much rules to it whatsoever, then yes, you're gonna get customers, I guess, that are treating the bike less responsibly. Because, what if I get a flat tire? I'm not even gonna fix it myself, I'm paying for you to swap it for me. So there's going to be more swapping than necessary, I think.
 Emile
Alright, and Swapfiets also asks its users to double lock their bikes and, if I am not mistaken, there's also an extra fee if your bike gets stolen and you don't return the keys or something. In any case, repairs are significantly cheaper.
 Marijn
That sounds fair enough.
 Emile
Yeah, how do you feel about a company telling you what to do with your own bike?
 Marijn
I don't really feel like they're telling me what to do because as a customer, one way or another you have a certain responsibility. I guess the most important thing is to have me knowing what I'm responsible for. If I do another "compared to Apple"-situation: when you have an extra Apple Care plus agreement, if you drop your brand new iPad on a train track - which you're never going to recover - it won't be replaced, because we want the original product back. It's in the rules, you agreed with that. People are tend to accept the rules without reading them. And a company is tended to have the rules offered in REALLY small details, making it not clear enough, and that's where customer dissatisfaction starts. So if I think that I don't need to have any responsibility for my bike, I don't even lock it. Because if you steal it, I just call to the swap bike company "get me a new bike", and then they start explaining me things I didn't know before, that's where I get unhappy. But, if you sell me this first brand new Swapfiets, congratulate me with my new super modern product... Just take your time and explain me what to do. It doesn't have to be very complicated, but have your customers know what they signed up for.

 Emile
Alright, interesting, thank you. Uhm, Maartje, do you have any questions left?
 Maartje
Well, it is very nice to hear such a different point of view. Let's say that, so, the modern part is very new to me, so that that's really nice. 
 Marijn
Alright.
 Maartje
So, we did touch upon all the barriers, I would say.
 Emile
I think so, yeah. So then, yeah, seeing that the time of the interview is nearing to an end, is there anything that you would still like to add which we did not discuss before?
 Marijn
No, can't really think of anything.
 Emile
All right. Yeah, it's still interesting to see whether you will actually adopt a Swapfiets in the future or not.
 Marijn
I'm not a 100% sure about it. I have to take a look at the price maybe.
 Maartje
Well, I thought there are different subscriptions, but the the cheapest version with just one gear is I think around €12 a month so. So well with with your habit of knowing how to deal with bikes, it could be more expensive, but there are quite a few perks of course.

 Emile
Yeah, do you think that that would present a good monetary deal, Marijn?
 Marijn
Not yet. I'm not really sure about it yet, but yeah, I'm also considering that I'm moving out of this part of town, so I already figured that I don't really necessarily need a bike right now because I'm working from home. And why not buy a bike when you can stall it somewhere safe? And yeah, if I can find a bike, comparing in quality to a Swapfiets, of €50, being a little more careful with it, fixing it myself when I need to, will save me, of course, lots of money instead. But I do think that Swapfiets should target their audience in the bigger cities, where where bike thieves are more active.
 Maartje
Yeah, and maintenance is hard if you always have to stall it outside or not in a garage or something.
 Marijn
Exactly. There's lots of glass on the floor on the on the cycling paths here, so if you not really good at fixing a flat tire, it will be very easy to just hop to your local Swapfiets company and then just swap it right away.
 Maartje
For sure, so maybe this part is a very good deal, very smart.
 Marijn
Yeah, and I think they really should target the audience who are really into this "not stressing about this maintenance". But of course you should have your customer know what they exactly sign up for, instead of them thinking "I'm not even going to lock that", for sure.
 Maartje
Yeah.
 Marijn
I'm gonna swap it if it gets stolen. You know that that that's where the where the dissatisfaction from your customers can start when they don't have the right information. And if you have to look it all up in the small details yourself.. people don't do that. Not even with a very expensive phone or computer, they just click accept and then think if there's something wrong, the company will fix it for me. And that's why I'm spending half of my days explaining procedures to unhappy customers, reading them their own responsibilities, and I don't think you want that.
 Emile
Out of all things sustainable, this is not one of them. I think that concludes our interview, Marijn. Thank you very much for your time and your insights.
 Marijn
You're welcome.
 Emile
Could we contact you if we maybe may need clarification on some of your answers?
 Marijn
Yes, of course.
 Emile
All right, and yeah, with that goodnight and you can leave the call.
 Marijn
Likewise, thank you very much.
 Emile
Yes.
 Marijn
Yeah, good luck on the project.
 Emile
Thank you, adios.
 Marijn
Bye.
