 Kees
Hello.
 Emile
Good day to you Kees.
 Emile
This is my good friend Lukas who is also without a face.
 Kees
Good afternoon Mr no face.
 Lukas
Hello wait, let's see, I'm just gonna briefly... Hello, how do you do?
 Kees
Hi Lukas.
 Lukas
OK, I'm gonna turn off because otherwise my teams crashes.
 Kees
Oh haha
 Lukas
It is a problem.
 Emile
Uh, how has your day been Kees? Are you doing good?
 Kees
Yeah alright well so so.
 Emile
All right, all right, cool. So the video I just sent you, I take it you watched it?
 Kees
No, because you sent that link at 4:00 and I was very busy.
 Emile
Ah, that is OK.
 Emile
Lukas could you then pop up the Swapfiets commercial on your share screen?
 Lukas
I can definitely try that.
 Emile
You need the link? Ah you got it open.
 Lukas
No no, I have it in there in the Google Doc. Yes, give me just a second... Share screen... Slowly... OK, screen two, that's it. You should be able to see something soon now.
 Kees
Yeah.
 Emile
Yeah, let's hope that works.
 Lukas
It's loading.
 Kees
I have got a screen.
 Emile
Let's hope that the connection works, yeah.
 Lukas
OK thanks, yeah here we go, let's play. I don't know if you hear sound.
 Emile
And there's there's no sound yet.
 Lukas
Jammer.
I could open it on my end.
 Emile
Yeah, I mean it's 30 seconds.
 Lukas
That might be better.
 Emile
If you have link, yeah, that might be easier.
 Kees
Now. OK, let's see.

*Kees proceeds to watch the Swapfiets commercial*

 Kees
OK, watched it.
 Emile
Okay, that was all you need to know for this interview.
 Kees
Right, amazing!
 Emile
Amazing, all right.
 Lukas
We just passed!
 Emile
So the recording is already running, is it OK to record?
 Kees
Yeah, absolutely.
 Emile
All right, then to start off with some background information, what is your name?
 Kees
My name is Kees, Kees Koenders.
 Emile
Kees Koenders and how old are you?
 Kees
I am 26 years old.
 Emile
26. And could you tell me what your general occupation is, like what do you do each day and what do you study?
 Kees
I am studying physics and astronomy at the University of Amsterdam.
 Emile
Alright, and that's a masters?
 Lukas
But you live in Utrecht?
 Kees
Yes, and it's a Masters degree, yeah.

 Emile
All right, and those are the first things. OK so, Lukas and I are doing a qualitative research, on Swapfiets, and in specific why there are certain people that decide not to use Swapfiets. So instead of looking at adoption, we're looking at non-adoption.
 Kees
Yeah.
 Emile
So given the fact that you do not own and have never owned a Swapfiets, if I am Correct?
 Kees
Yes that's correct.
 Lukas
Good.
 Emile
Right, yeah, we would like to ask you a couple of questions as to find out the reasoning behind this.
 Kees
Alright

 Emile
First off, could you tell me something about your biking habits?
 Kees
My biking habits actually have changed a bit, but I'll start off with how I've been biking for, like, the past seven years. I use my bike for literally everything. Everything that's within an hour's reach by bike. I would bike. Also if it was raining or snowing, whatever the weather, because I hate public transport because it gets you there even slower than by bike. Less security than by bike, you have to be on time because if you miss the bus, you're fucked, the bus can be early. It doesn't work for me. I like being in control of my own destiny. And so, I probably bike at least an hour a day, but depending on how much I had to do, I'd bike more.
 Lukas
Wow.
 Kees
But then I started studying in Amsterdam, and well, that's not close by. So I do that all with public transport. And now I have a dog with my girlfriend, so I am traveling more and more with public transport because it's the general way I can bring my dog with me because I don't have a car, but I still very much prefer to bike to places within Utrecht. Whenever the bike is faster, 10 minutes faster, I will take the bike because I just don't like wasting time. And it feels nice being outside.

 Emile
It is. Alright, and what do you then think of Swapfiets?
 Kees
Eh *shrug*. I think it's a great idea for people who are not familiar with how bikes work, fixing stuff yourself, and how much it costs to get a bike repaired and maintained regularly.
 Lukas
Yeah.
 Kees
So I think it's a great concept, especially for people who are new to the city. Coming here, if you need a bike temporarily it can be absolutely great, because it's like, basically a lease, so yeah. But I also think it's too expensive.
 Emile
All right, so suppose your bike would break down now, would you consider getting a Swapfiets or not?
 Kees
Well, see I'm in the position that I would never - well not never - but with their current lineup of bicycles, I wouldn't be able to get one because they don't have my frame size. I have an extra large frame size because otherwise my legs won't be able to fully extend downwards and I need that bike ergonomics.
 Lukas
Oh, that's clever. So how tall are you then?
 Kees (answered in post)
197 cm.
 Kees
Let's say that they had a nice bike for me, if the price was right, I would consider it because the idea of having total security seems nice. Then again, after almost a decade or longer, but the decade of biking as a individual living on my own in charge of my own financials. It doesn't cost that much to maintain a bike, it doesn't break down it often. If you pay attention a little bit to your bike you it will keep running, you will never have it suddenly break down. That doesn't really happen, it happens like once every few years. So for that single instance of bike-complete-breakdown I can handle it, I don't need to pay how many average euros a month Swapfiets is charging.
 Emile
All right.
 Kees
And I don't like the fact that they have their "bagegedrager", their baggage platform, on the front of the bike, it's attached to the front wheel. And that means that if you go into a corner, you are moving your payload a lot, so it's it's just it's bad for your, uh, circular momentum. Yeah, it doesn't work, it doesn't work nicely. It would have been better if it's attached to the frame. That's the best balance, but they don't do that, so it's kind of a useless "bagagedrager".

 Emile
Interesting. So could you tell me if you think that Swapfiets is presenting a good monetary deal or not?
 Kees
For the individual? Depends how much money you find... Well, First off it depends how much time you need to be able to learn about maintaining a bike, how much time you would be putting into maintaining a bike, and how expensive and how nearby your bicycle repair specialist is. And how much you find it worth to not to think about at all, so the "convenience fee", you could say. That differs for a lot of people, I would say. I don't think it's worth it, clearly. But in a similar light there are these phone plans which offer unlimited data. You don't need unlimited data, most people need like 5 gigs, maybe 10, maybe 20. I chose to go with unlimited, because I like the freedom of always having a good and fast connection, and not be tethered by the amount of data I can use. It's only really useful a few times a year, and I'm paying a premium for it, but the fact that I don't think about it and I know I'll always be good and connected, I think it's worth it. For a bike that's then not the case.
 Emile
Alright, so then would you say that it would be a form of agency, that you would require in your own bike, or how would you word it?
 Kees
No, it's not like I want my bike to be customized, and that bike to be mine, and me being the one doing it all. It's just that me doing it all and keeping an eye on it, is just financially way more attractive.
 Emile
Alright, so yeah, and you don't mind carrying the the time / financial load yourself.
 Kees
Exactly, I know how bikes work and a bicycle repair guy will not be able to rip me off - because there are some out there that do really rip off. So yeah, I can feel like I can stand my own grounds and I don't need the service that Swapfiets is offering.

 Emile
All right, let's move onto the responsibility that comes up. When you use a bike from Swapfiets, you are a customer of the company and they also have an interest in not immediately losing all of their bikes. So, then how responsible would you feel towards a leased bike like Swapfiets compared to a bike that you own?
 Kees
Uhm, I think I would feel less responsibilities, but still quite some. I feel like I'm pretty I'm a responsible person,I don't like wasting stuff. I don't like taking actions that has negative consequences for another, just for my own convenience. But I would certainly worry less about it. So in effect, I think there is a chance that that might lose to bike easier, or if I really come into some situation where the lock doesn't work, but I have to be somewhere on time, I might just leave it and not worry about the bike getting stolen, for instance. So I think there is a larger risk involved.
 Emile
And would you feel guilty if you would damage or lose your Swapfiets?
 Kees
Yes. Guilty enough. I don't think it would weigh me down too much to prevent the behavior.

 Emile
OK. Swapfiets also asks its users to double lock their bikes, how do you feel about a company telling you what to do?
 Kees
Eh *shrug*. I think it's OK. I would say they know about bikes, and know about bikes being stolen - they probably know better than I do. And assuming I didn't know much about it, I would be fine with them telling me the best practices with their products.

 Emile
All right now, given that Swapfiets essentially boils down to a sharing economy, and the bikes get reused, so to make it a little more circular. What are your views on using a Swapfiets which has possibly been used before by another person?
 Kees
As long as it works, completely fine. I don't care where it came from, I only care what it does for me.
 Emile
And do you think it would be contaminated?
 Kees
No.
 Emile
And compared to a secondhand bike, you would get in a in a store?
 Kees
I have always owned second hand bikes - never in my life have I had a new bike - and I would assume that if a company is offering me a service of a good working bike, that the quality of the bike will be as good as they can have it be. And if I were to be dissatisfied with what they deliver, I would also assume they would give me a replacement.

 Emile
Alright, and then what do you think about Swapfiets', reliability and performance of the bike in specific?
 Kees
Yeah, I don't know much about the reliability of it. I don't have many anecdotes from friends, I know two friends who have one and I haven't heard them complain about it. So all I can say is I haven't seen many break down. The performance you heard me about, I don't like their baggage handler, it's just, I don't think it's functional and the bike shape isn't right for me. So for me, functionally it wouldn't suffice.
 Emile
OK, so arguably it would be a good bike, but not it wouldn't be a good bike for you?
 Kees
Yeah, absolutely.
 Emile
Yeah, that's an interesting thing.

 Emile
Well then, could you elaborate a little bit on to what extent you think that's Swapfiets does or does not fit your lifestyle?
 Kees
I do think they would fit my lifestyle, since I do cycle a lot, I like to cycle. So always having a working bike is a quite attractive position. And not having to worry about the time to repair the bike is also attractive, so you can just continue with what you're doing. And say for instance, if I were to transition from 'student' to doing an actual job. A job I like, where I'm doing things that I find important for society, for instance. Then I wouldn't be wanting to spend an hour of my afternoon getting my bike fixed. I would want to be at work doing what I love and getting paid for it. I completely still want to be riding bikes when I am working later. Even though I'll probably have a car, a car is for completely different things than just going to work.
 Emile
OK, so Swapfiets might actually match with that.
 Kees
Yeah. Or some other form of that same business model. You could also have a bike servicing model where you don't necessarily... or the company doesn't own the bike, but the company does own the fleet of electric vans that come to service your bike whenever you need it.
 Emile
Interesting.
 Kees
I think I might actually be more interested in that, because it's more flexible and allows you to really have a bike that fits you in every aspect. So it will have the right size, it will have your preferred steering, it will have your preferred saddle, it will have your preferred frame type, it will have you preferred tires, your brakes, those kind of things can all matter for different people.
 Emile
So it would be about finding a bike that would fit you.
 Kees
Yeah, the most important thing for me is that the bike fits me. The service aspect of Swapfiets, I found very interesting. I do understand that it's inherently their business model to have their own bike, so they can just swap out the exact same bike for the one you had. But I don't mind having to ride a different bike for a few days, until I can get my own back.

 Emile
All right, do you feel attached to your own bike?
 Kees
Uhm. No, no I don't. I'm very happy with it. I don't want it to break, but that's mainly because I know it's going to be a pain in the ass to find a new one of this frame size.
 Emile
All right, so it's about a specific utility.
 Kees
Yeah.
 Emile
And would you then feel attached to Swapfiets bike?
 Kees
No, absolutely not.
 Emile
Even less so?
 Kees
Yeah. Because you don't own the product your a customer of the service. Like I don't feel attached to my phone plan, I don't feel attached to my Internet plan, I wouldn't feel attached to my Swapfiets.

 Emile
Alright, and could you tell me a little bit about how you feel about Swapfiets as a brand?
 Kees
I think they market very well. I think they have a strong brand. The name is very descriptive about their products, I think. Because I like it and I would assume other people also like that "what you see is really what you get". And yeah, that's basically what there is to say about the brand. Their styling is good, their marketing seems slick and not too long, short, sweet. Yeah, comes across as a strong band.
 Emile
And how do you feel about bike ownership?
 Kees
I don't know.
 Emile
Do you feel like a bike needs to be owned or should be owned.
 Kees
I don't.. I don't think so for a commuter's bike. I think it changes when you do for biking for sport, because then you get into real important customizations, and then you can get an attachment to your bike because you probably, like, built half of it yourself, you know. But as long as it's just for going to work and going to a party, that kind of stuff, I don't see any need to own a bike. It might, in society, be better to have a shared network of bikes where there is less waste and more convenience.
 Emile
Yeah, but then for you to adopt such a bike, it would need to fit you.
 Kees
Absolutely.

 Emile
Could you tell me a little bit about how complicated you think it would be to get a Swapfiets?
 Kees
I think you probably just sign up and you'll have one the next day.
 Emile
The next day.
 Kees
Yeah, that's what I would think that they could do. Or unless they're not big enough then you'd probably be on the waiting list.
 Emile
Alright, and how complicated do you think it would be to register?
 Kees
I don't think it be very complicated to just enter an email and passwords, and payments through iDeal or authorized for monthly payments. At least with our systems it's done very quickly and easily, so I don't think there is a big barrier to entrance.
 Emile
And concerning the repair service that Swapfiets offers, how complicated or how easy do you think it would be to use that?
 Kees
I think it'd be easy. I'm not sure, like, it would be great if there's an app where you just press a button and you immediately get the information, the people will be there within X amount of time, but at the very least you could probably call a phone number and they would have people on their way to swap out your bike.
 Emile
All right, and to what extent do you trust the service to then supply you in time with a replacement?
 Kees
I don't have a feeling for that. If I were to consider getting a Swapfiets, this is really something I would research first, so "what is the average wait time?" I understand that it's not possible to reach 100%, you know, coverage of getting bikes fixed within an hour, because sometimes you can just have a statistical improbability where a lot of people suddenly need to use the service and then it's unavailable. And also that will be smaller for a larger company than for a smaller bike store for instance. So I think comparing to your own local bike store, it might be better, but it really depends on their internal goals, really. How much money do they want to make? The less amount of reserve bikes they have, the more money they will make, so it really does depend on what line they are walking themselves, but I think it could be very reliable. It has the potential.
 
 Lukas
You kind of already touched upon the lifestyle that Swapfiets stands for, and like, about your lifestyle and how you'd maybe have to change it. So generally, we have a... it's about compatibility, and if we shift away from focus on you, but maybe focus on other people who use Swapfiets, people like... So do you have any ideas what kind of lifestyle Swapfiets would stand for? Or do you have any associations, with that? So like what kind of people... like...
 Kees
Mobility.
 Lukas
Mobility.
 Kees
Not high mobility because you are constrained to one mode of transport, but it's just a way to ensure you will always be mobile. You will almost always be ready to go, wherever you need to go, and I think that will appeal to a lot of people who are going to be spending a lot of time in studying, working, socializing and will not necessarily be living at the same place. Like students, who probably change student houses every few years, or change cities as well. With Swapfiets you don't need to take your bike, they'll probably give you one in the other city. So yeah, the people who just have a lot of uncertainty in where they'll be located, and how their schedule looks, and who need to be on the road a lot and would like being on the road with a bike.
 Lukas
And do you differ from them? So these students who are young professionals that are always on the go, almost always under tension, going from A to B.
 Kees
No, not much. Especially in the last 7-8 years, that was basically what I was doing. But like I said before, things are changing a bit now I'm becoming more of what we call a "burger" in Dutch.
 Lukas
So like citizen stuff?
 Kees
Yeah, so peace and quiet, same place. We have a dog now so.
 Lukas
Yeah, moving in with the girlfriend.
 Kees
Exactly, I guess.

 Lukas
So do you have any other stereotypes associated with Swapfiets? For the users?
 Kees
Uhm, the biggest stereotype would be first year students.
 Lukas
First year students in particular, yeah.
 Kees
Yeah, especially first year students who took part in the citywide introduction, the UIT, the Utrechtse Introductie Tijd. And I would also say then, after that, people who are part of a student association.
 Lukas
A "vereniging"?
 Kees
Yeah. A "studentenvereniging", so not for a specific study, but just for a group of students and you have like, really the frat kind of people. I would assume they would have Swapfietses, because they come over to me as people who really don't give a shit about... either money and people outside of their bubble. So Swapfiets would fit them perfectly, just, "I'm gonna go drink and just gonna throw my bike against this three over here. And if it's not here when I get back I'll walk home and I'll get a new one tomorrow."
 Lukas
Is that the group of users that you also imagine? So, not only those people that are like active and going from A to B and moving along and don't have a fixed life...
 Kees
Or careless. 
 Lukas
...but also probably just really careless.
 Kees
Yeah, I can imagine that.
 Lukas
Wow, OK.
 Emile
And how do you differ from them?
 Kees
From the last group I described?
 Emile
Yeah.
 Kees
I'm a bit of the polar opposite. I care too much that everyone other than me, about sustainability and, yeah. So really a different side of it. Like I said before, I do care about convenience, but it shouldn't go at the cost of others, or the ecology around me.

 Emile
Alright, thank you. Lukas, I think we covered all of our questions.
 Lukas
Maybe Kees, has an idea of how much Swapfiets costs per month.
 Kees
Swapfiets? Like 15 euros, like a little bit more than a Netflix subscription. One secondhand bike a year in cost.
 Emile
So it's comparable.
 Kees
To buying a secondhand bike every year, yeah.
 Emile
One secondhand bike every year, all right.
 Kees
I mean, if I extend this question to what I think it would cost to maintain a bike. I'd say between 50 and €100 a year, depending on your luck.
 Emile
OK.
 Lukas
I think now we have everything, yeah?
 Emile
Yeah, Kees is there anything that you would still like to add, which we did not discuss?
 Kees
Uhm, no. I think I yeah I spoke all I needed to speak.
 Lukas
And thank you for that.
 Emile
All right then. Very well, thank you for your time Kees and your answers and insights. Can we could we contact you if we maybe need clarification on any answers?
 Kees
Sure.
 Emile
Alright, good to know. And on that remark, thank you for your time, have a nice day. I will see you in person in a minute, but that's something else.
 Kees
Hahaha.
 Emile
And yeah, and you can leave the call.
 Kees
Yeah, thank you and it was nice seeing you Lukas.
 Lukas
Alright, pleasure to meet you, or hear you rather., 
 Kees
Good luck on your quantitative study.
 Lukas
Good luck with your dinner.
 Kees
Thank you, sir, very nice. Bye bye!
