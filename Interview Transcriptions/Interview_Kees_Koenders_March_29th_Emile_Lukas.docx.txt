 Kees
Hello.
 Emile
Good day to you Kees.
 Emile
This is my good friend Lucas who is also without a face.
 Kees
Good afternoon Mr no face.
 Lukas
Hello wait, let's see, I'm just gonna briefly... Hello, how do you do?
 Kees
Hi Lukas.
 Lukas
OK, I'm gonna turn off because otherwise my teams crashes.
 Kees
Oh haha
 Lukas
It is a problem.
 Emile
Uh, how has your day been Kees? Are you doing good?
 Kees
Yeah alright well so so.
 Emile
All right, all right, cool. So the video I just sent you, I take it you watched it?
 Kees
No, because you sent that link at 4:00 and I was very busy.
 Emile
Ah, that is OK.
 Emile
Lukas could you then pop up the Swapfiets commercial on your share screen?
 Lukas
I can definitely try that.
 Emile
You need the link? Ah you got it open.
 Lukas
No no, I have it in there in the Google Doc. Yes, give me just a second... Share screen... Slowly... OK, screen two, that's it. You should be able to see something soon now.
 Kees
Yeah.
 Emile
Yeah, let's hope that works.
 Lukas
It's loading.
 Kees
I have got a screen.
 Emile
Let's hope that the connection works, yeah.
 Lukas
OK thanks, yeah here we go, let's play. I don't know if you hear sound.
 Emile
And there's there's no sound yet.
 Lukas
Jammer.
I could open it on my end.
 Emile
Yeah, I mean it's 30 seconds.
 Lukas
That might be better.
 Emile
If you have link, yeah, that might be easier.
 Kees
Now. OK, let's see.

*Kees proceeds to watch the Swapfiets commercial*

 Kees
OK, watched it.
 Emile
Okay, that was all you need to know for this interview.
 Kees
Right, amazing!
 Emile
Amazing, all right.
 Lukas
We just passed!
 Emile
So the recording is already running, is it OK to record?
 Kees
Yeah, absolutely.
 Emile
All right, then to start off with some background information, what is your name?
 Kees
My name is Kees, Kees Koenders.
 Emile
Kees Koenders and how old are you?
 Kees
I am 26 years old.
 Emile
26. And could you tell me what your general occupation is, like what do you do each day and what do you study?
 Kees
I am studying physics and astronomy at the University of Amsterdam.
 Emile
Alright, and that's a masters?
 Lukas
But you live in Utrecht?
 Kees
Yes, and it's a Masters degree, yeah.

 Emile
All right, and those are the first things. OK so, Lukas and I are doing a qualitative research, on Swapfiets, and in specific why there are certain people that decide not to use Swapfiets. So instead of looking at adoption, we're looking at non-adoption.
 Kees
Yeah.
 Emile
So given the fact that you do not own and have never owned a Swapfiets, if I am Correct?
 Kees
Yes that's correct.
 Lukas
Good.
 Emile
Right, yeah, we would like to ask you a couple of questions as to find out the reasoning behind this.
 Kees
Alright
 Emile
First off, could you tell me something about your biking habits?
 Kees
My biking habits actually have changed a bit, but I'll start off with how I've been biking for, like, the past seven years. I use my bike for literally everything. Everything that's within an hour's reach by bike. I would bike. Also if it was raining or snowing, whatever the weather, because I hate public transport because it gets you there even slower than by bike. Less security than by bike, you have to be on time because if you miss the bus, you're fucked, the bus can be early. It doesn't work for me. I like being in control of my own destiny. And so, I probably bike at least an hour a day, but depending on how much I had to do, I'd bike more.
 Lukas
Wow.
 Kees
But then I started studying in Amsterdam, and well, that's not close by. So I do that all with public transport. And now I have a dog with my girlfriend, so I am traveling more and more with public transport because it's the general way I can bring my dog with me because I don't have a car, but I still very much prefer to bike to places within Utrecht. Whenever the bike is faster, 10 minutes faster, I will take the bike because I just don't like wasting time. And it feels nice being outside.
 Emile
It is. Alright, and what do you then think of Swapfiets?
 Kees
Eh *shrug*. I think it's a great idea for people who are not familiar with how bikes work and fix stuff yourself and how.
 Kees
How much it costs?
 Kees
To get a bike repair it's and maintained regularly.
 Lukas
Yeah.
 Kees
So I I think it's a great concept, especially for people who are.
 Kees
Or new things?
 Kees


 Kees
Things.
 Kees
City or coming in here.
 Kees
If you need a bike temporarily can be absolutely great because it's like basically at least.
 Kees
So yeah, but I also think it's too expensive.
 Emile
All right, so suppose your bike would breakdown now would you consider getting a Swapfiets or not?
 Kees
Well, see I'm in the position that I would never well, not never, but with their current lineup of bicycles, I wouldn't be able to get one because they don't have my frame size.
 Kees
I have an extra large frame size because otherwise my legs won't be able to fully extend downwards and.
 Lukas
Oh, that's clever.
 Kees
I just did that invite Ergonome.
 Kees
Thanks.
 Kees
I can't have that so, but let's say recently things right.
 Lukas
So how old are you then?
 Kees
Let's say that this had a nice buy for me.
 Kees
If the price was right, I would consider it because the idea of having total security seems nice.
 Kees
Then again, after almost a decade or longer, but the decade of biking as a individuals living on my own and charge my own financials.
 Kees
It doesn't cost that much to maintain a bike.
 Kees
It doesn't break down it often.
 Kees
If you pay attention a little bit to your bike you it will keep running.
 Kees
You will never have it suddenly breakdown.
 Kees
This doesn't really happen.
 Kees
It happens like once every few years.
 Kees
So for that single instance of bike complete breakdown I can I can handle it.
 Kees
Need to pay how many every euros a month swap it is charging.
 Emile
All right?
 Kees
And they don't like the fact that they have their big at the garage, but has a darker or baggage platform on the front of the bike.
 Emile
Yeah.
 Kees
It's attached to the front wheel.
 Kees
And it means that if you go into a corner.
 Kees
You are moving your payload a lot, so it's it's just it's bad for your recall.
 Kees
It's circular momentum.
 Kees
Yeah, it doesn't work.
 Kees
It doesn't work nicely.
 Emile
All right?
 Kees
It would be better.
 Kees
It would have been if it's attached to the frame.
 Kees
That's the best balance and put.
 Kees
They don't do that, so it's kind of a useless.
 Kees
Bacaj rocker.
 Emile
Interesting, so could you.
 Emile
Could you tell me if you think that Swapfiets is presenting a good monetary deal or not?
 Kees
For the individual depends how much money you find.
 Kees
Well, First off it depends how much time you need to be able to learn about maintaining a bike, how much you time you would be putting into maintaining a bike, an how expensive and how nearby your.
 Kees
Bicycle repair specialist is.
 Emile
So.
 Kees
And how much you find it worth to not to think about at all.
 Kees
So the convenience fee even say and that differs for a lot of people, I would say.
 Kees
Hey.
 Kees
I don't think it's worth it clearly, but I can in a similar light.
 Kees
There are these phone.
 Kees
Plans which offer unlimited data.
 Kees
You don't need to limit.
 Kees
Most people need like 5 gigs maybe 10, maybe 20.
 Kees
I chose to go with unlimited because I like the freedom of always having a good and fast connection and not gathered by the amount of data I can use and it's only really useful a few times a year.
 Kees
And I'm paying a premium for it, but the fact that I don't think about it and I know I'll always be good and connected.
 Kees
I think it's worth it.
 Kees
Or the bike that's then not the case.
 Emile
Alright, so then would you.
 Emile
Would you say that it would be a form of agency?
 Emile
It that you require in your own bike or how would you word it?
 Kees
No, not not, not and.
 Kees
It's it's not like I I want my bag to be customized and get back to be my Nan.
 Kees
Me being one doing it all.
 Kees
It's just that me doing it all and keeping an eye on it.
 Kees
It's just financially way more attractive.
 Emile
Alright, so yeah, and you don't.
 Kees
Yeah.
 Kees


 Emile
You don't mind carrying the the time slash financial load yourself.
 Kees
Exactly, I know how bikes work and.
 Lukas
Uh huh.
 Kees
A bicycle repair guy will not be able to rip me off because there are there are some out there that do really.
 Kees
Of.
 Kees
So yeah, I can feel like I can say I can set my own grounds and I don't need the service.
 Emile
So.
 Emile


 Kees
That's what Pete is offering.
 Emile
All right, let's let's move onto.
 Emile
The the the responsibility that comes up when you use a bike from Swapfiets you you are a customer of the of the company and they also have an interest in not immediately losing all of their.
 Emile
Bikes so, but then, how responsible would you feel for towards a least bike like swap feats compared to a bike that you own?


Yeah.
 Kees
An I think I would feel less responsibilities.
 Kees
But still quite some.
 Kees
I feel like I'm pretty I'm a responsible person.
 Kees
I don't like wasting stuff I don't like.
 Kees
Taking action that has negative consequences for another, just for my own convenience, but I would certainly worry less about it.
 Kees
So in effect I think there is a chance that that might lose to black easier, or if I really come into some situation where the lock doesn't work, but I have to be somewhere on time, I might just leave it on.
 Kees
About the bike getting stolen, for instance.
 Emile
Yeah.
 Kees
So I think there is a larger risk involved.
 Emile
And would you feel guilty if you would damage or lose your swap feats?
 Kees
Yes.
 Kees
Yes.
 Emile
Yes.
 Emile


 Emile
And.


That
 Kees
Gives you enough and not.
 Kees
I wouldn't.
 Kees
I don't think it would.
 Kees
Weigh me down too much to prevent the behavior.
 Emile
OK, and Swapfiets also asks its users to double lock their bikes.


Ah.
 Emile
Honey, how do you feel about a company telling you what to do?
 Kees
Yeah.
 Kees
I think it's OK.
 Emile
Alright, so you don't think it's.
 Kees
Yes I would.
 Kees
Say they know about bikes and know about bikes being stolen.
 Kees
They probably know better than I do.
 Kees
And assuming I didn't know much about it, I would be fine with them telling me the best practices with their products.
 Emile
All right now, given that swap feet is.
 Emile
The IT it essentially boils down to a sharing economy.
 Emile
And the bikes get reused, so to make it a little more circular, what are your views on using a Swapfiets which has possibly been used before by another person?
 Kees
As long as it works completely fine.
 Kees
I don't care where it came from, I should only care what it does for me.
 Emile
Yes.
 Emile
And do you think it would be contained?
 Emile
Emanated
 Kees
Now.
 Emile
And compared to a secondhand bike, you would get in a in a store.
 Kees
I have always owned second hand bikes never in my life have I had a new bike and I would assume that if a company is offering me a server group working bike that the quality of the bike will be as good as they can have it be.
 Kees
And if I were to be dissatisfied with what they deliver.
 Kees
I would also assume they would give me a replacement.
 Emile
Alright, and then what do you think about swap features, reliability and performance of the bike in specific?
 Kees
Yeah, I don't know much about the reality of route.
 Kees
Well reliability of and I don't have many anecdotes from friends.
 Kees
I I know two friends who have one and I haven't heard them complain about it.
 Kees
So all I can say is I haven't seen many breakdown or the performance you hurt me about.
 Kees
I don't like their baggage baggage handler.
 Kees
It's just I don't think it's functional and the bike shape isn't right for me.
 Kees
So for me, functionally it wouldn't suffice.
 Emile
OK, so.
 Emile
Arguably it would be a good bikes, but not it wouldn't fit.
 Emile
See a good bike for you, yeah?
 Emile
Yeah.
 Emile


 Emile
Or
 Kees
Absolutely.
 Emile
So then.
 Emile
Yeah, that's that's an interesting thing.
 Emile
Well then could you elaborate a little bit on to what extent you think that's what feats does or does not feel fits your lifestyle?
 Kees
I I do think they would fit my lifestyle since I do.
 Kees
I do cycle a lot.
 Kees
I like to cycle.
 Kees
So even always having a working bike is fine.
 Kees
This is quite attractive.
 Kees
Position and not having to worry about time to put in time to repair the bike is also attractive, so you can just continue with what you're doing.
 Kees
And say for instance, if I were to transition from students to doing an actual job.
 Kees
A job I like where I'm doing things that I I find important for society, for instance.
 Kees
Then I wouldn't be wanting to spend an hour in my afternoon getting my bike fixed.
 Kees
I would want to be at work doing what I love and getting paid for it so.
 Kees
Because I I'd completely still want to be riding bikes when.
 Kees
I am working later.
 Kees
Even though I'll probably have a car.
 Kees
R is for.
 Kees
Completely different things than just going to work.
 Emile
OK, so Swapfiets might actually match with that.
 Kees
Yeah.
 Emile
Uh.
 Kees
Or or or.
 Kees
Some other form of that same business model?
 Kees
If you don't have a bike servicing model or you don't necessarily or the company doesn't own the bike, but the company does on the fleets of electric vans that come to service your bike whenever you need it.
 Emile
But
 Emile
Interesting.
 Kees
I think I might actually be more interested in that because it's more flexible and allows you to really have a bike that fits you in.
 Kees
And in every aspect.
 Kees
So we'll have to right size.
 Kees
It will have your preferred steering.
 Kees
It will have your preferred saddle.
 Kees
It will have your preferred frame type.
 Kees
It will have you preferred tires, your brakes, those kind of things can all matter for different people.
 Emile
All right, so so.
 Kees
OK so I.
 Kees
OK, I
 Emile
So it would be about finding a bike that would fit you.
 Kees
Yeah, the most important thing for me is that the bike fits me.
 Kees
At the service aspect of swap beats, I found very interesting.
 Kees
I do understand that it's inherently their business model to have their own bike, so they can just swap out the exact same bike for the one you had.
 Kees
But I don't mind having riding a different bike for a few days and I can get my own back.
 Emile
All right, do you feel attached to your own bike?


Ann
 Kees
No, no I don't.
 Emile
Well.
 Kees
Very happy with it.
 Kees
I don't want to break, that's mainly because I know it's going to be a pain in the *** to find a new one of his frame size.
 Emile
All right, so it's about a specific utility.


Yeah.
 Emile
And then you would.
 Emile
Would you then feel attached to swap feet by core?
 Kees
No, absolutely not.
 Emile
Even even less so.
 Kees
Yeah.
 Kees
Because you're not.
 Kees
You know the products your your your customer service.
 Kees
So like I don't feel attached to my phone plan, I don't feel attached to my Internet plan.
 Kees
Wouldn't feel attached to my shop, please.
 Emile
Alright.
 Emile


 Emile
Alright, and could you tell me a little bit about how you feel about swap feats as a brand?
 Kees
I think they market very well.
 Kees
I think they have a strong brand.
 Kees
The name is very descriptive about their products I think because I like it and I would assume other people also like that that you see is really what you get.
 Emile
An at yeah.
 Kees
It's basically there is to say about the brands that are styling is good, so marketing seems slick and not too long, short, sweet.


Yeah.
 Kees
Yeah, comes across as a strong band.
 Kees
I mean.
 Emile
And how do you feel about bike ownership?
 Emile
I don't know.
 Emile
You you feel like.
 Emile
Yes.
 Emile


 Emile
A bike needs to be owned or should be owned.
 Kees
I don't.
 Kees
I don't think so. For a commuter's bike.
 Kees
I think.
 Kees
I.
 Kees
It changes when you do.
 Kees
Bike for biking for sports.
 Kees
Because then you get into real.
 Kees
Important customizations, and then you can get an attention to your back because you probably like build had fit yourself, you know.
 Kees
But as long as it's just for going to work and going to a party, that kind of stuff.
 Kees
I don't see any need to own a bike.
 Kees
Might be in society, better to have a shared network of bikes.
 Kees
Partners less waste.
 Kees
And more convenience.
 Emile
Yeah, but then for you to adopt such a bike, it would need to fit you.
 Emile
Absolutely yeah.
 Emile
Flip.
 Emile


 Emile
Could you tell me a little bit?
 Emile
About how complicated you think it would be to get a Swapfiets.
 Kees
I think you probably just sign up and you'll have one the next day.
 Emile
The next day.
 Kees
Yeah, that's what I would think that they could do.
 Kees
Or unless you're not big enough then you'd probably be on the waiting list.
 Emile
Alright, and
 Emile
How complicated do you think it would be to register?
 Kees
I don't think it be very complicated to just enter an email and passwords.
 Kees
And payments through.
 Kees
Ideal or authorized for monthly payments that's at least with our systems.
 Kees
It's done very quickly and easily, so I don't think there is a big barrier to entrance.
 Emile
And concerning the repair service, that's what these offers.
 Emile
How complicated or how easy do you think it would be to use that?
 Kees
I think it be easy.
 Kees
I I'm not sure like I would be great if there's an app or you just press the button and you get you need to get the information out of people.
 Kees
We will be there within X amount of time but at the very least you could probably call phone number and they would have people on their.
 Kees
Way to spot your bike.
 Emile
All right, and do you to what extent do you trust the service to then supply you in time with a replacement?
 Kees
I don't have an feeling for that. I'm saying I if if I were to look if I were to consider getting a swap meet. This is really something I would research first. So what is the average wait time? I understand that it's not possible to reach 100%.
 Kees
You know, coverage of getting bikes fixed within an hour because sometimes you can just have a statistical improbability where a lot of people suddenly need to use the service and then it's unavailable.
 Kees
And also that will be smaller for a larger company than for a smaller bikes or for instance.
 Kees
So I think comparing to your own local bike store, it might be better, but it really did.
 Kees
It really depends on their internal goals really.
 Kees
How much money do you want to make?
 Kees
The least amount of reserve bikes they have, the more money they will make, so it really does depend on what line they are walking themselves, but I think it could be very reliable.
 Kees
But I think it's.
 Kees


 Emile
Just a blank potential.
 Lukas
Maybe?
 Lukas
You kind of already touched upon the lifestyle.
 Lukas
That's what Pete stands for and or like?
 Lukas
What about your lifestyle now?
 Lukas
You maybe after?
 Lukas
Change it so generally we have a.
 Lukas
It's about compatibility and if you if you shift away from focus on you but maybe focus on other people who you Swapfiets we will like.
 Lukas
So do you have any ideas what kind of lifestyle Swapfiets would stand for?
 Lukas
Or Germany Association?
 Lukas
With that, so like what kind of people were kind of like.
 Kees
Hilti.
 Lukas
Sorry, sorry.
 Kees
Mobiliti
 Lukas
Ability.
 Kees
And not high probability because it's you you are constrained to one mode of transport.
 Kees
But it's it's just a way to ensure you will always be mobile.
 Kees
You all are almost always be ready to go wherever you need to go, and I think that will appeal to a lot of people.


Oh
 Kees
You are going to be spending a lot of time.
 Kees
Is studying, working socializing and will not necessarily be living at the same place like students who probably change student houses every few years.
 Lukas
Yeah.
 Kees
Or change cities as well if that's what fits.
 Kees
You don't need to take your back to probably give you one in the other city.
 Kees
So yeah, the people who just.
 Kees
Has a lot of uncertainty an where it'll be located and how their schedule look and who needs to be on the road a lot and would like being on the road with a bike.
 Lukas
I do differ from them, so these these students are young professionals that are always on the go, almost always on the tension.
 Lukas
Going from A to B.
 Kees
No, not much.
 Kees
Especially in the last 7-8 years, that was basically what I was doing, but like I ask for things are changing, but now I'm becoming more of what we call a.
 Lukas
Uh huh.
 Lukas
Yeah.
 Kees
Good color match.
 Lukas
So like citizen is stuff alright, thanks.
 Kees
Yeah, I I think quiet stream place.
 Kees
We have a dog now so.
 Lukas
Yeah, moving in with the girlfriend.
 Kees
Exactly.
 Kees


 Kees
Exactly, yeah, I guess.
 Lukas
So do you have any given the other stereotypes associated with Swapfiets?
 Lukas
Creepy for the users.
 Kees
At the biggest search up would be first year students.
 Lukas
First year students, particularly I think.
 Kees
Yeah, especially first year students who took part in the citywide introduction.
 Lukas
Yeah.
 Lukas


 Kees
Yeah, the introduction type.
 Kees
And I would also then after that, people who are part of a students at society.
 Kees
I don't know.
 Kees
It's what we just Association.
 Lukas
Have anything?
 Kees
Yeah?
 Kees
So those students without anything so really not.


Yeah.
 Kees
It's not very specific study there just for a group of students and you have like.
 Emile
Yeah, yeah.
 Kees
Really different kind of people.
 Kees
Ann
 Kees
I I would assume they would have swap pieces because they come up with these people who.
 Kees
Really don't give a **** about.
 Kees
Either money and people outside of their bubble.
 Kees
Yes.
 Kees


 Kees
So I stopped with him perfectly just and I'm gonna go drink and is going to throw my bike against this three over here.
 Kees
And if it's not here when I get back I'll walk home and I'll get a new one tomorrow.
 Lukas
Is that the group of users you like that you also imagine?
 Lukas
So, not only those people that are like active and going from A to B and moving along and don't have a fixed life, but also probably just really careless.
 Kees
Or careless.
 Lukas
Yeah.
 Lukas


 Kees
Yeah, I can imagine that.
 Lukas
But OK.
 Emile
And how do you differ from them?
 Kees
I am the last group I described.
 Emile
Yeah, yeah.
 Emile
Yeah.
 Kees
Yeah, I'm I'm a bit of the polar opposite.
 Kees
I care too much that everyone about Maine about sustainability and.
 Lukas
I see.
 Kees
Yeah, so the really different side of it.
 Kees
Like like I said before, I do care about convenience, but it shouldn't go at the cost of others.
 Kees
Or the ecology around me?
 Emile
Alright, thank you.
 Emile
Yeah Lucas, I think we covered all of our questions.
 Lukas
Maybe maybe cases, and as an as an idea of how much it's what feeds costs per month box, yeah?
 Kees
This country.
 Kees
Like 15 euros, like a little bit more than a Netflix subscription.
 Lukas
50 or 15.
 Kees
Fifteen 1/5.
 Kees


 Kees
1/5
 Lukas
OK, yeah.
 Emile
All right?
 Kees
Yep, secondhand bike year and cost.
 Kees
And cost.
 Kees


 Emile
OK so it's compareable.
 Kees
To buying a secondhand bike every year, yeah.
 Emile
One secondhand bike.
 Emile
Every year, all right.
 Kees
I mean, if I sent this question to what I think it would cost to maintain a bike.
 Emile
Uh huh.
 Kees
I'd say between 50 and €100 a year, depending on your luck.
 Emile
OK.
 Lukas
I think now we have everything, yeah?
 Emile
Yeah, in case is there anything that you would still like to add which we did not discuss?
 Kees
Yeah no I think I yeah I spoke.
 Kees
All I need is to speak.
 Lukas
Yeah, and thank you for that.
 Kees
All right then.
 Emile
Very well, thank you for your time case and your answers and insights.
 Emile
Can we could we contact you if we maybe need clarification on any answers?
 Kees
Not sure.


Sure.
 Emile
Alright, good to know and on that remark.
 Emile
Thank you for your time.
 Emile
Have a nice day I I will see you in person in a minute, but that's something else and yeah and not there right now so.
 Kees
No.
 Kees
Yes.
 Emile
Yeah, and you can.
 Emile
Yeah you can leave the call.
 Kees
Yeah, thank you man.
 Kees
It was nice seeing you look us.
 Lukas
Alright, pleasure to meet you or hear you brother, but good luck with your dinner.
 Kees
Good what your quantitative study.
 Kees
Thank you Sir.
 Kees
Very nice bye bye.


Yeah.
 Lukas
Uh, I'm just taking out all the axes here.
 Emile
All right, yeah, to sum it up there, it's it doesn't apply like cases cases case doesn't apply specifically to these seven things.
 Lukas
Thank you.
 Emile
And so it it's.
 Emile
But I think from his answers we can gather that he does not use swap seats because they do not have the bike for him.
 Emile
Because in case you asked how tall he is, he is freakishly tall.
 Emile
Uh huh.
 Emile


 Emile
Oh yeah, he's he's.
 Emile
He's a giant an he's is over 6 foot man and he's very big guy as well and he has.
 Lukas
Cheese
 Emile
Yes, Alers down loss which is a little bit of a handicap which effects his scracthing is there?
 Emile
There's a word for that.
 Emile
Give me a second cockbain cartilage.
 Lukas
OK.
 Emile
Oh OK, yeah.
 Emile
Yeah, and as such he very much he pays a lot of attention to making him himself physically comfortable and physically able to use things for a longer amount of time.
 Emile
So a bike which will not bike.
 Lukas
Uh huh.
 Emile
Like 100% OK and I'm I'm a bit filling in but I I've known this guy for eight years. A bike that would not be 100% OK for his legs would be an absolute no like that would be the last thing that he does and if I I would even go as far to say that if you if you had a swap free subscription.
 Lukas
Yeah.
 Lukas
Right?


Yes.
 Emile
And he said, OK, I am a big guy.
 Emile
Can you get me back and they said yeah sure we'll get you a proper bike and they get one and it's not good.
 Emile
He will move hell on Earth.
 Emile
Uh huh.
 Emile


 Lukas
Even murder, yeah.
 Emile
He would murder people and just be on the on the customer service for hours upon hours just waiting to be angry at someone for this.
 Lukas
Jeez.
 Emile
Yeah, but but but that that is one part of the answer and I think another part is that he.
 Lukas
Right?
 Emile
A man.
 Emile
And that's something that I felt in Lisana an mine as well.
 Emile
And maybe it's because we ask a question about stereo types, but their answers all resonate the same thing.
 Emile
There's still, I have a stereo type of swap feed users and I see myself as not part of that group, and sometimes even the polar opposite.
 Emile
And case started like listing negative aspects of the event.


Nothing.
 Lukas
And you're not stereotypes.
 Lukas
Has maybe been the wrong word.
 Emile
Yeah, it may have been.
 Lukas
There is that.
 Emile
It may have been.
 Emile
It's yeah, yeah, definitely.
 Emile
'cause this was the last interview so and we'll also have to research the other.
 Emile
A couple of interviews.
 Emile
But I feel like that that is a legitimate reason, though, that people have a certain image about not the brand, but about the users of the brand.
 Lukas
Yeah.
 Emile
So I would classify we could classify that under image Barry.
 Lukas
Yes and then.
 Emile
There's an that image of these users is just not compatible with their image.
 Lukas
2nd order image.
 Lukas
2nd order.
 Emile
Yeah, with their image of themselves and as such they retained to their old habits and come up with a multitude of reasons.
 Lukas
Huh?
 Emile
A lot of them involving economics.
 Emile
Or compatibility with your own lifestyle.
 Emile
Oh, or some other things, and even though I think all of those are legitimate reasons and this is a little bit speculative and very hard to test, especially without further research.
 Lukas
Yeah yeah, yeah.
 Emile
But it might even be the core cause that because swap fees grew so much under the first years that everyone who is not a first year.
 Lukas
Yeah.
 Emile
Like looked at them, it was like.
 Lukas
Please let me know.
 Emile
These people are really treating their bikes like **** I'm going to not do that.
 Lukas
I'm gonna head out.
 Lukas
Yeah and yeah indeed.
 Lukas


 Lukas
And yeah, indeed.
 Emile
Yeah, because it swapped feeds really grew rapidly under first years because they did a very smart marketing trick and then I feel like it just capped.


Uh huh.
 Emile
Because their growth was just a one group like Bam.
 Emile
OK, all these people do not know the service.
 Emile
Do not know the customs of the city yet.
 Emile
Let's give them our product and it was genius.
 Emile
But all the people that have lived in the city saw this happen and they were like.
 Lukas
Yeah, yeah.
 Emile
I mean.
 Emile
I could I could not.
 Lukas
Yeah.
 Lukas
Pretty much the same happened when I was in Denmark, where I did a summer school multiple one anyway, so we that we were given a Swapfiets from the University.
 Lukas
And then basically people in the was really tiny town started complaining about these these students with their Swapfiets blocking the roads and yadda yadda yadda.
 Lukas
So I think there's actually this actually has a.
 Lukas
Definitely have that as a as a grounding, or like if there is definitely a reasoning.
 Emile
Yeah.
 Emile
Yeah, if it's the core reason or like how important it is, I don't know, but there is definitely an impact a measurable impact, certain qualities of the first big adopter group of Swapfiets.
 Lukas
I was picking up.
 Lukas
No.
 Lukas
Yeah, yeah.
 Emile
And how people then react to that?
 Lukas
Normative isn't it? Yeah yeah.
 Emile
Interesting, and I've also heard the.
 Lukas
That's for sure.
 Emile
I've also heard the argument.
 Emile
I already had a bike a lot of times.
 Lukas
A lot of times I mean, you already have a bite.
 Emile
A lot of time.
 Emile


 Emile
Time.
 Lukas
Handsome, but like.
 Emile
It's like why don't you have a swap feats?
 Emile
Because I already have a bike.
 Lukas
Oh, OK, but this is like this is the question.
 Emile
And that way, yeah.
 Lukas
This is what the question is.
 Lukas
If we're back with breakdown, would you consider getting this Whole Foods so fast was really like?
 Emile
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So it's.
 Lukas
Yeah, definitely.
 Lukas
I think it's a great thing.
 Lukas
To dot dot dot.
 Emile
Yeah.
 Emile


 Lukas
So yeah.
 Emile
It's it's it's.
 Lukas
For example, Oscar was like I, I just don't.
 Lukas
I just don't like the attitude of not fixing your bike yourself.
 Emile
And then all of a sudden it's about attitudes and values and stuff.
 Emile
And that's that's really that the yeah, the first adopter group.


Right?
 Lukas
Yeah.
 Lukas
Chapter one.
 Emile
Very interesting.


Phil.
 Lukas
In it.
 Emile
Very interesting alright.
 Emile
Case was also cooking my dinner so I am going to hang up if that's all the same to you.
 Lukas
Go for that.
 Lukas
Of course I'm going to go for Frisbee.
 Emile
Oh yeah.
