Sprecher 1
Nice.
 Speaker 3
Yes.
 Speaker 1
OK, so recording has started and I will just move this one and I have this and that this stuff please yes shall I focus on getting the keeping the conversation going?


Thanks.
 Speaker 3
Yep, I think so.
 Speaker 1
All right?
 Speaker 3
My my brilliant plan in my pasta interviews was that you make an X after every co-owner they've done there, so that it is to make an X after every question that you've asked already.


Uh huh.
 Speaker 3
And then.
 Speaker 1
Oh, marches marches, removing all of them actually.


Absolutely.
 Speaker 3
Yeah, yeah, right?


She.
 Speaker 3
Because they're through with the interview, so I did that with Fleurent salvia and I reckon that much too and.
 Speaker 1
Yeah, I'm pretty sure they.
 Speaker 3
Thank you my dear.
 Speaker 3
Jane is planned, isn't IT service really clever exactly?
 Speaker 1
Yeah, yeah.
 Speaker 1
I think I think that the interviews are going really great.
 Speaker 1
I'm not sure.
 Speaker 1
Yeah.
 Speaker 1


 Speaker 1
Yeah, I'm not sure if we're carrying out the interviews as best as we can, but yeah, I mean, it's the first time we're interviewing people, like in an academic study so.
 Speaker 3
Exactly exactly.
 Speaker 3
Exactly, by the way, Oscar that who I interviewed then with the five year?
 Speaker 1
Uh huh.
 Speaker 3
Yeah, I had a did a course on qualitative study and he kindly did not say no enough to proposing.
 Speaker 3
Hey if you want you can read our study once it's done.
 Speaker 3
So he actually said yes, I can do that, so that's pretty great.
 Speaker 1
As a proofreader.
 Speaker 3
And yeah, and I think in his interview it was pretty clear that the barriers are, you know, the various that we're researching are pretty nice.


Cool.
 Speaker 3
But they so Oscar was like, well, I just don't like it.
 Speaker 3
So these kinds of mental barriers.
 Speaker 3
We don't really have like so the socialization process.
 Speaker 1
Yeah.
 Speaker 3
Is not it's not.
 Speaker 3
At all, reflection of these barriers.
 Speaker 1
Yeah.
 Speaker 1
Yeah, I feel like what I the impression I got from the interview with Lisa Ann Meringue as well was that they.


Yeah.
 Speaker 1
Because I asked both of them to describe like the stereotypical swap feats biker and they both describe this very young student first year next generation, and then when prompted it at least as a conclusion I drew is that they do not.


Uh huh.
 Speaker 3
And next year, yeah?
 Speaker 1
And they identify themselves as a different group from that one, which, which is also why.
 Speaker 3
Yeah, yeah, definitely.
 Speaker 1
They feel like ah is swapped.
 Speaker 1
This is not for me because it's it's for.
 Speaker 1
It's for the other people.
 Speaker 1
I mean I got the regular.
 Speaker 1
I got the regular secondhand bike and I know how to fix it and that works just fine and a it's it's.
 Speaker 3
Exactly the knowing how to fix it.
 Speaker 1
It's cheaper and.
 Speaker 3
Yeah, exactly.
 Speaker 1
Yeah, it's it's values from like the previous generation and the values from the next generation is that are then going to be well, we just need bikes and we have a lot so why not do it in a bit more circular way or something?
 Speaker 1
Yeah.
 Speaker 1


 Speaker 1
Right?
 Speaker 1


 Speaker 1
Do it a bit differently and this generation was like.
 Speaker 1
In the middle.
 Speaker 1
Our our generation and yeah I'm not entirely sure we like to call that the millennials.
 Speaker 3
Indeed.
 Speaker 3
It's it's a bit.
 Speaker 1
Yeah.
 Speaker 3
It's very hard, I don't know.
 Speaker 1
Yeah, because we have a bit.
 Speaker 3
Some, so hopefully it's going.
 Speaker 1
Yeah, millennials is like two.
 Speaker 1
I feel like it's too broad of a category and it's.
 Speaker 1
It doesn't necessarily apply to this situation, but.
 Speaker 3
It does not show you where you were just going.
 Speaker 3
It doesn't apply to what?
 Speaker 1
Do this situation too at this specific case like OK, yes, Age difference.
 Speaker 3
I think yeah.
 Speaker 1
An generations definitely at play millennials.
 Speaker 1
Not millennials delineated in a different way, like.
 Speaker 3
Uh huh.
 Speaker 1
In in generate in terms of student generations almost where I would be one generation of my time would be the previous one and then the next generation is doing the swap feeds.
 Speaker 3
Yeah.
 Speaker 3
Pretty much when we when mean flirt talked with the bus.
 Speaker 3
Who was the second interview?
 Speaker 3
There was one phrase that really stuck with me which so he said yes, what pieces for all these sustainable mobile students and young professionals and whatever?
 Speaker 3
And then we asked, of course how different from them and he's like?
 Speaker 3
I don't different from them.
 Speaker 3
I don't at all.
 Speaker 3
And then.
 Speaker 3
Yeah, I, I think I think it's either a question of.
 Speaker 3
Generation, but it doesn't really make sense because it's very, very narrow scope that we're that we're taking care of, or like that that work that we're investigating.
 Speaker 1
Yeah.
 Speaker 3
So yeah, I'm I'm.
 Speaker 3
I'm a bit worried about what we can.
 Speaker 1
I'm pretty, I'm pretty sure we can write something decent out of this.
 Speaker 1
Right in right.
 Speaker 1




Yeah.
 Speaker 3
Yeah, yeah.
 Speaker 3
I mean, a negative result is also a nice result, but yeah.
 Speaker 1
Yeah, for quality.


I.
 Speaker 1
For qualitative you dented I feel like negative results for for quantitative is very fine because then you just test the hypothesis and it might be wrong.
 Speaker 3
Oh thanks.
 Speaker 3
Yeah.
 Speaker 1
But in the case of qualitative.
 Speaker 1
Yeah.
 Speaker 1


 Speaker 1
I feel like you search for a a good answer and it's.
 Speaker 1
Like, yeah, like we're we're also on a time limit, so eventually we will have to stop and write up a thing and that.
 Speaker 3
Right?
 Speaker 3
I forgot about that.
 Speaker 1
And I'm pretty sure that the teachers are going to take that into account.
 Speaker 3
Hopefully yeah.
 Speaker 3
Hopefully.
 Speaker 1
Yeah, but if you say if you were a PhD or a professional.
 Speaker 1
Researcher, then, if you would research and the research would result in HA.
 Speaker 3
Yeah.
 Speaker 1
OK, actually, I've got like a bunch more questions and I'm not entirely sure what we're doing.
 Speaker 1
What I can say about this?
 Speaker 1
Then you research it again.
 Speaker 1
Then you conduct another round of interviews.
 Speaker 1
Or you realign an.
 Speaker 3
Yeah, this.
 Speaker 1
You take next steps.
 Speaker 1
I was reading Breiman just now, an because we're going to have a lecture about grounded theory tomorrow.
 Speaker 1
Uh huh.
 Speaker 1


 Speaker 1
Bro.
 Speaker 1
Uh-huh
 Speaker 1
And I think that it feels like that's like the gist of it.
 Speaker 1
Just you look and you find an answer and you keep looking until your answer is good.
 Speaker 1
But yeah.
 Speaker 3
Huh?
 Speaker 3
I.
 Speaker 3
I would have thought this would be more quantitative, but it's like OK, your hypothesis doesn't check out at all.
 Speaker 3
You just keep looking until it's fixed it.
 Speaker 3
Thanks again, because numbers don't really lie unless they're scarcely available.
 Speaker 3
But maybe I should attend tomorrow's lecture then that makes sense, yeah?
 Speaker 1
Yeah.
 Speaker 1


 Speaker 1
I would definitely attend lectures and read material because I feel like that's also a good way to just pass the course.
 Speaker 1
So.
 Speaker 1


 Speaker 3
Well, I have done that for.
 Speaker 3
For the first part.
 Speaker 3
And now with this exam, I really don't know how this is going to be.
 Speaker 1
Yeah.
 Speaker 3
And the sample skit, and usually I never attend lectures because I dislike it a lot.
 Speaker 3
Yeah, it's just not my learning type.
 Speaker 3
Getting up in the morning and then sitting.
 Speaker 3
Have you heard of him?
 Speaker 3
Is he going to school today?
 Speaker 1
Yeah yeah yeah he just messaged me.
 Speaker 3
Oh
 Speaker 1
And that's OK.
 Speaker 1
I think he's watching the yeah, this is arguably my best friend.
 Speaker 3
So this is your friend of yours, so.
 Speaker 3
Oh OK, yeah.
 Speaker 1
I've known him for eight years.
 Speaker 3
Jesus.
 Speaker 1
He is the drummer in my band and he placed the Spirit drums and wrap up around.
 Speaker 1
I know.
 Speaker 3
This is for example.
 Speaker 1
Yeah.
 Speaker 1
What I mean is we were in a band together and like out of all the people considering our different music tastes an our tendencies to write certain certain kinds of music.
 Speaker 3
How?
 Speaker 3
Oh yes.
 Speaker 1
Yeah, case really fits my style the best and it it's just we resonate with each other.
 Speaker 1
And it did.
 Speaker 1


 Speaker 1
Did we admit him?
 Speaker 3
I think you.
 Speaker 3
Did Oh no there is is waiting in the lobby.
 Speaker 1
His dad is waiting in the lobby and now it is case.
 Speaker 3
OK.
 Speaker 1
Hello hello so.
 Speaker 1
Hello.
 Speaker 1


 Speaker 1
Good day to you case.
 Speaker 1
This is my good friend Lucas who was also without a face.
 Speaker 1
Thanks.
 Speaker 1


 Speaker 2
Good afternoon Mr no thanks.
 Speaker 3
Hello wait, let's see, I'm just gonna briefly hello, how do you do?
 Speaker 2
Hi Lucas.
 Speaker 3
OK, I'm gonna turn off because otherwise my teams crashes like.
 Speaker 2
Oh
 Speaker 3
It is a problem.
 Speaker 1
Like we.
 Speaker 1
Like
 Speaker 1
We all right.

All right, all right.
 Speaker 1
Cool you the video I just sent you.

 Speaker 2
No, because you sent that link at 4:00 and I was very busy.
 Speaker 1
No, that that is OK.
 Speaker 1
Lucas.
 Speaker 1
Could you then pop up the swap feet commercial on your share screen?
 Speaker 1
Oh yeah.
 Speaker 1


 Speaker 3
I can definitely try not on 2nd.
 Speaker 1
You need the link and you got it open.
 Speaker 3
I don't know.
 Speaker 3
I have it in there in the Google Doc.


Yes.
 Speaker 3
Give me just a second.
 Speaker 3
Share screen.
 Speaker 3
Slowly.
 Speaker 3
OK, screen two, that's it.
 Speaker 3
You should be able to see something soon now.
 Speaker 2
Yeah.
 Speaker 1
Yeah, let's hope that steps.
 Speaker 3
It's loadings.
 Speaker 2
I have got a screen.
 Speaker 1
Let's hope that the.
 Speaker 1
The connection works, yeah.
 Speaker 3
OK thanks, yeah here we go, let's plan.
 Speaker 3
I don't hear sound.
 Speaker 1
And there's there's no sound yet.


Snow.
 Speaker 1
Yeah.
 Speaker 3
Summer.
 Speaker 3
I don't know if it's.
 Speaker 2
I could open it on my end.
 Speaker 1
Yeah, I mean it's it's it's 30 seconds.
 Speaker 3
It might be better.
 Speaker 1
If you have link.
 Speaker 3
Yeah, well, the two dogs.
 Speaker 1
Yeah, might be easier.
 Speaker 2
Now.
 Speaker 2
OK, let's see.
 Speaker 3
Yeah yeah man.
 Speaker 3
Not today.
 Speaker 2
OK, what should?
 Speaker 1
I write.
 Speaker 1
I.
 Speaker 1
Now, right that is.
 Speaker 3
Thank you.
 Speaker 1
Yeah, that was all you need to know for this interview.
 Speaker 2
Right, amazing.
 Speaker 2
Right?
 Speaker 1
Amazing all right.
 Speaker 3
We just passed.
 Speaker 1
So the recording is already running.
 Speaker 1
Is it OK to record?
 Speaker 2
Right?
 Speaker 2
Absolutely.
 Speaker 1
All right, then to start off with some background information, what is your name?
 Speaker 2
Name is Kate. Hey, schooners.
 Speaker 1
K scooters and how old are you?
 Speaker 2
I AM 26 years old.
 Speaker 1
26
 Speaker 1
And could you tell me it?
 Speaker 1
Could you tell me what your general occupation is like?
 Speaker 1
What do you do each day and what do you study?
 Speaker 2
Sorry.
 Speaker 2
I am studying physics and astronomy at the University of Amsterdam.
 Speaker 1
Right?
 Speaker 1
And that's a massive.
 Speaker 3
But you live in it.
 Speaker 2
After you some Masters degree, yeah.
 Speaker 2
Yeah.
 Speaker 2


 Speaker 1
All right, and those are the first things.
 Speaker 1
Well, OK so.
 Speaker 1
Lucas and I are doing a research, a qualitative research on.
 Speaker 1
And swap feeds an in specific.
 Speaker 1
While there are certain people that decide not to use swap feeds, so instead of looking at adoption, we're looking at non adoption.
 Speaker 3
Yeah.
 Speaker 1
So given the fact that you do not own an have never owned a swap feeds, if I.
 Speaker 1
Correct?
 Speaker 2
I guess that's.
 Speaker 1
Right, yeah, we would like to ask you a couple of questions as to find out the reasons.
 Speaker 3
Good.
 Speaker 1
The reasoning behind this.


Right?
 Speaker 1
And First off, could you tell me something about your biking habits?
 Speaker 2
And my banking has actually have changed a bit, but I'll start off with how I've been back and forward like the past seven years. I use my bike for literally everything. Everything that's within an hour's reach by bike. I would bike. Also it was raining or snowing or whatever the weather.
 Speaker 3
Uh huh.
 Speaker 2
Because I hate public transport because it gets you there even slower than by bike.
 Speaker 2
Less security than like you have.
 Speaker 2
You have to be on time because if you miss the bus your fact the bus can be early.
 Speaker 2
Yeah.
 Speaker 2


 Speaker 2
It doesn't for me.
 Speaker 2
I like being controlled my own destiny.
 Speaker 2
And so I probably bike.
 Speaker 2
At least.
 Speaker 2
An hour a day, but.
 Speaker 2
An hour a day.
 Speaker 2
But depending on how much I had to do, I'd like more.
 Speaker 1
Wow.
 Speaker 2
But then I started studying in Amsterdam and well, that's not close by, so they do that all public transport.
 Speaker 2
And now I have a doc with my girlfriends, so I am traveling more and more public transport because the general way I can bring your dog with me because I don't have a car, but I still very much prefer to bike to places with the new tracks, right?
 Speaker 2
Whenever, whenever the bike is faster, 10 minutes faster, and I will take the bike because I just don't like wasting time.
 Speaker 2
Adds boost for you mean feels not being outside.
 Speaker 1
It is alright, and what do you then think of swap feeds?
 Speaker 2
I think it's a great idea for people who are not familiar with how bikes work and fix stuff yourself and how.
 Speaker 2
How much it costs?
 Speaker 2
To get a bike repair it's and maintained regularly.
 Speaker 3
Yeah.
 Speaker 2
So I I think it's a great concept, especially for people who are.
 Speaker 2
Or new things?
 Speaker 2


 Speaker 2
Things.
 Speaker 2
City or coming in here.
 Speaker 2
If you need a bike temporarily can be absolutely great because it's like basically at least.
 Speaker 2
So yeah, but I also think it's too expensive.
 Speaker 1
All right, so suppose your bike would breakdown now would you consider getting a swap feeds or not?
 Speaker 2
Well, see I'm in the position that I would never well, not never, but with their current lineup of bicycles, I wouldn't be able to get one because they don't have my frame size.
 Speaker 2
I have an extra large frame size because otherwise my legs won't be able to fully extend downwards and.
 Speaker 3
Oh, that's clever.
 Speaker 2
I just did that invite Ergonome.
 Speaker 2
Thanks.
 Speaker 2
I can't have that so, but let's say recently things right.
 Speaker 3
So how old are you then?
 Speaker 2
Let's say that this had a nice buy for me.
 Speaker 2
If the price was right, I would consider it because the idea of having total security seems nice.
 Speaker 2
Then again, after almost a decade or longer, but the decade of biking as a individuals living on my own and charge my own financials.
 Speaker 2
It doesn't cost that much to maintain a bike.
 Speaker 2
It doesn't break down it often.
 Speaker 2
If you pay attention a little bit to your bike you it will keep running.
 Speaker 2
You will never have it suddenly breakdown.
 Speaker 2
This doesn't really happen.
 Speaker 2
It happens like once every few years.
 Speaker 2
So for that single instance of bike complete breakdown I can I can handle it.
 Speaker 2
Need to pay how many every euros a month swap it is charging.
 Speaker 1
All right?
 Speaker 2
And they don't like the fact that they have their big at the garage, but has a darker or baggage platform on the front of the bike.
 Speaker 1
Yeah.
 Speaker 2
It's attached to the front wheel.
 Speaker 2
And it means that if you go into a corner.
 Speaker 2
You are moving your payload a lot, so it's it's just it's bad for your recall.
 Speaker 2
It's circular momentum.
 Speaker 2
Yeah, it doesn't work.
 Speaker 2
It doesn't work nicely.
 Speaker 1
All right?
 Speaker 2
It would be better.
 Speaker 2
It would have been if it's attached to the frame.
 Speaker 2
That's the best balance and put.
 Speaker 2
They don't do that, so it's kind of a useless.
 Speaker 2
Bacaj rocker.
 Speaker 1
Interesting, so could you.
 Speaker 1
Could you tell me if you think that swap feeds is presenting a good monetary deal or not?
 Speaker 2
For the individual depends how much money you find.
 Speaker 2
Well, First off it depends how much time you need to be able to learn about maintaining a bike, how much you time you would be putting into maintaining a bike, an how expensive and how nearby your.
 Speaker 2
Bicycle repair specialist is.
 Speaker 1
So.
 Speaker 2
And how much you find it worth to not to think about at all.
 Speaker 2
So the convenience fee even say and that differs for a lot of people, I would say.
 Speaker 2
Hey.
 Speaker 2
I don't think it's worth it clearly, but I can in a similar light.
 Speaker 2
There are these phone.
 Speaker 2
Plans which offer unlimited data.
 Speaker 2
You don't need to limit.
 Speaker 2
Most people need like 5 gigs maybe 10, maybe 20.
 Speaker 2
I chose to go with unlimited because I like the freedom of always having a good and fast connection and not gathered by the amount of data I can use and it's only really useful a few times a year.
 Speaker 2
And I'm paying a premium for it, but the fact that I don't think about it and I know I'll always be good and connected.
 Speaker 2
I think it's worth it.
 Speaker 2
Or the bike that's then not the case.
 Speaker 1
Alright, so then would you.
 Speaker 1
Would you say that it would be a form of agency?
 Speaker 1
It that you require in your own bike or how would you word it?
 Speaker 2
No, not not, not and.
 Speaker 2
It's it's not like I I want my bag to be customized and get back to be my Nan.
 Speaker 2
Me being one doing it all.
 Speaker 2
It's just that me doing it all and keeping an eye on it.
 Speaker 2
It's just financially way more attractive.
 Speaker 1
Alright, so yeah, and you don't.
 Speaker 2
Yeah.
 Speaker 2


 Speaker 1
You don't mind carrying the the time slash financial load yourself.
 Speaker 2
Exactly, I know how bikes work and.
 Speaker 3
Uh huh.
 Speaker 2
A bicycle repair guy will not be able to rip me off because there are there are some out there that do really.
 Speaker 2
Of.
 Speaker 2
So yeah, I can feel like I can say I can set my own grounds and I don't need the service.
 Speaker 1
So.
 Speaker 1


 Speaker 2
That's what Pete is offering.
 Speaker 1
All right, let's let's move onto.
 Speaker 1
The the the responsibility that comes up when you use a bike from swap feeds you you are a customer of the of the company and they also have an interest in not immediately losing all of their.
 Speaker 1
Bikes so, but then, how responsible would you feel for towards a least bike like swap feats compared to a bike that you own?


Yeah.
 Speaker 2
An I think I would feel less responsibilities.
 Speaker 2
But still quite some.
 Speaker 2
I feel like I'm pretty I'm a responsible person.
 Speaker 2
I don't like wasting stuff I don't like.
 Speaker 2
Taking action that has negative consequences for another, just for my own convenience, but I would certainly worry less about it.
 Speaker 2
So in effect I think there is a chance that that might lose to black easier, or if I really come into some situation where the lock doesn't work, but I have to be somewhere on time, I might just leave it on.
 Speaker 2
About the bike getting stolen, for instance.
 Speaker 1
Yeah.
 Speaker 2
So I think there is a larger risk involved.
 Speaker 1
And would you feel guilty if you would damage or lose your swap feats?
 Speaker 2
Yes.
 Speaker 2
Yes.
 Speaker 1
Yes.
 Speaker 1


 Speaker 1
And.


That
 Speaker 2
Gives you enough and not.
 Speaker 2
I wouldn't.
 Speaker 2
I don't think it would.
 Speaker 2
Weigh me down too much to prevent the behavior.
 Speaker 1
OK, and swap feeds also asks its users to double lock their bikes.


Ah.
 Speaker 1
Honey, how do you feel about a company telling you what to do?
 Speaker 2
Yeah.
 Speaker 2
I think it's OK.
 Speaker 1
Alright, so you don't think it's.
 Speaker 2
Yes I would.
 Speaker 2
Say they know about bikes and know about bikes being stolen.
 Speaker 2
They probably know better than I do.
 Speaker 2
And assuming I didn't know much about it, I would be fine with them telling me the best practices with their products.
 Speaker 1
All right now, given that swap feet is.
 Speaker 1
The IT it essentially boils down to a sharing economy.
 Speaker 1
And the bikes get reused, so to make it a little more circular, what are your views on using a swap feeds which has possibly been used before by another person?
 Speaker 2
As long as it works completely fine.
 Speaker 2
I don't care where it came from, I should only care what it does for me.
 Speaker 1
Yes.
 Speaker 1
And do you think it would be contained?
 Speaker 1
Emanated
 Speaker 2
Now.
 Speaker 1
And compared to a secondhand bike, you would get in a in a store.
 Speaker 2
I have always owned second hand bikes never in my life have I had a new bike and I would assume that if a company is offering me a server group working bike that the quality of the bike will be as good as they can have it be.
 Speaker 2
And if I were to be dissatisfied with what they deliver.
 Speaker 2
I would also assume they would give me a replacement.
 Speaker 1
Alright, and then what do you think about swap features, reliability and performance of the bike in specific?
 Speaker 2
Yeah, I don't know much about the reality of route.
 Speaker 2
Well reliability of and I don't have many anecdotes from friends.
 Speaker 2
I I know two friends who have one and I haven't heard them complain about it.
 Speaker 2
So all I can say is I haven't seen many breakdown or the performance you hurt me about.
 Speaker 2
I don't like their baggage baggage handler.
 Speaker 2
It's just I don't think it's functional and the bike shape isn't right for me.
 Speaker 2
So for me, functionally it wouldn't suffice.
 Speaker 1
OK, so.
 Speaker 1
Arguably it would be a good bikes, but not it wouldn't fit.
 Speaker 1
See a good bike for you, yeah?
 Speaker 1
Yeah.
 Speaker 1


 Speaker 1
Or
 Speaker 2
Absolutely.
 Speaker 1
So then.
 Speaker 1
Yeah, that's that's an interesting thing.
 Speaker 1
Well then could you elaborate a little bit on to what extent you think that's what feats does or does not feel fits your lifestyle?
 Speaker 2
I I do think they would fit my lifestyle since I do.
 Speaker 2
I do cycle a lot.
 Speaker 2
I like to cycle.
 Speaker 2
So even always having a working bike is fine.
 Speaker 2
This is quite attractive.
 Speaker 2
Position and not having to worry about time to put in time to repair the bike is also attractive, so you can just continue with what you're doing.
 Speaker 2
And say for instance, if I were to transition from students to doing an actual job.
 Speaker 2
A job I like where I'm doing things that I I find important for society, for instance.
 Speaker 2
Then I wouldn't be wanting to spend an hour in my afternoon getting my bike fixed.
 Speaker 2
I would want to be at work doing what I love and getting paid for it so.
 Speaker 2
Because I I'd completely still want to be riding bikes when.
 Speaker 2
I am working later.
 Speaker 2
Even though I'll probably have a car.
 Speaker 2
R is for.
 Speaker 2
Completely different things than just going to work.
 Speaker 1
OK, so swap feeds might actually match with that.
 Speaker 2
Yeah.
 Speaker 1
Uh.
 Speaker 2
Or or or.
 Speaker 2
Some other form of that same business model?
 Speaker 2
If you don't have a bike servicing model or you don't necessarily or the company doesn't own the bike, but the company does on the fleets of electric vans that come to service your bike whenever you need it.
 Speaker 1
But
 Speaker 1
Interesting.
 Speaker 2
I think I might actually be more interested in that because it's more flexible and allows you to really have a bike that fits you in.
 Speaker 2
And in every aspect.
 Speaker 2
So we'll have to right size.
 Speaker 2
It will have your preferred steering.
 Speaker 2
It will have your preferred saddle.
 Speaker 2
It will have your preferred frame type.
 Speaker 2
It will have you preferred tires, your brakes, those kind of things can all matter for different people.
 Speaker 1
All right, so so.
 Speaker 2
OK so I.
 Speaker 2
OK, I
 Speaker 1
So it would be about finding a bike that would fit you.
 Speaker 2
Yeah, the most important thing for me is that the bike fits me.
 Speaker 2
At the service aspect of swap beats, I found very interesting.
 Speaker 2
I do understand that it's inherently their business model to have their own bike, so they can just swap out the exact same bike for the one you had.
 Speaker 2
But I don't mind having riding a different bike for a few days and I can get my own back.
 Speaker 1
All right, do you feel attached to your own bike?


Ann
 Speaker 2
No, no I don't.
 Speaker 1
Well.
 Speaker 2
Very happy with it.
 Speaker 2
I don't want to break, that's mainly because I know it's going to be a pain in the *** to find a new one of his frame size.
 Speaker 1
All right, so it's about a specific utility.


Yeah.
 Speaker 1
And then you would.
 Speaker 1
Would you then feel attached to swap feet by core?
 Speaker 2
No, absolutely not.
 Speaker 1
Even even less so.
 Speaker 2
Yeah.
 Speaker 2
Because you're not.
 Speaker 2
You know the products your your your customer service.
 Speaker 2
So like I don't feel attached to my phone plan, I don't feel attached to my Internet plan.
 Speaker 2
Wouldn't feel attached to my shop, please.
 Speaker 1
Alright.
 Speaker 1


 Speaker 1
Alright, and could you tell me a little bit about how you feel about swap feats as a brand?
 Speaker 2
I think they market very well.
 Speaker 2
I think they have a strong brand.
 Speaker 2
The name is very descriptive about their products I think because I like it and I would assume other people also like that that you see is really what you get.
 Speaker 1
An at yeah.
 Speaker 2
It's basically there is to say about the brands that are styling is good, so marketing seems slick and not too long, short, sweet.


Yeah.
 Speaker 2
Yeah, comes across as a strong band.
 Speaker 2
I mean.
 Speaker 1
And how do you feel about bike ownership?
 Speaker 1
I don't know.
 Speaker 1
You you feel like.
 Speaker 1
Yes.
 Speaker 1


 Speaker 1
A bike needs to be owned or should be owned.
 Speaker 2
I don't.
 Speaker 2
I don't think so. For a commuter's bike.
 Speaker 2
I think.
 Speaker 2
I.
 Speaker 2
It changes when you do.
 Speaker 2
Bike for biking for sports.
 Speaker 2
Because then you get into real.
 Speaker 2
Important customizations, and then you can get an attention to your back because you probably like build had fit yourself, you know.
 Speaker 2
But as long as it's just for going to work and going to a party, that kind of stuff.
 Speaker 2
I don't see any need to own a bike.
 Speaker 2
Might be in society, better to have a shared network of bikes.
 Speaker 2
Partners less waste.
 Speaker 2
And more convenience.
 Speaker 1
Yeah, but then for you to adopt such a bike, it would need to fit you.
 Speaker 1
Absolutely yeah.
 Speaker 1
Flip.
 Speaker 1


 Speaker 1
Could you tell me a little bit?
 Speaker 1
About how complicated you think it would be to get a swap feeds.
 Speaker 2
I think you probably just sign up and you'll have one the next day.
 Speaker 1
The next day.
 Speaker 2
Yeah, that's what I would think that they could do.
 Speaker 2
Or unless you're not big enough then you'd probably be on the waiting list.
 Speaker 1
Alright, and
 Speaker 1
How complicated do you think it would be to register?
 Speaker 2
I don't think it be very complicated to just enter an email and passwords.
 Speaker 2
And payments through.
 Speaker 2
Ideal or authorized for monthly payments that's at least with our systems.
 Speaker 2
It's done very quickly and easily, so I don't think there is a big barrier to entrance.
 Speaker 1
And concerning the repair service, that's what these offers.
 Speaker 1
How complicated or how easy do you think it would be to use that?
 Speaker 2
I think it be easy.
 Speaker 2
I I'm not sure like I would be great if there's an app or you just press the button and you get you need to get the information out of people.
 Speaker 2
We will be there within X amount of time but at the very least you could probably call phone number and they would have people on their.
 Speaker 2
Way to spot your bike.
 Speaker 1
All right, and do you to what extent do you trust the service to then supply you in time with a replacement?
 Speaker 2
I don't have an feeling for that. I'm saying I if if I were to look if I were to consider getting a swap meet. This is really something I would research first. So what is the average wait time? I understand that it's not possible to reach 100%.
 Speaker 2
You know, coverage of getting bikes fixed within an hour because sometimes you can just have a statistical improbability where a lot of people suddenly need to use the service and then it's unavailable.
 Speaker 2
And also that will be smaller for a larger company than for a smaller bikes or for instance.
 Speaker 2
So I think comparing to your own local bike store, it might be better, but it really did.
 Speaker 2
It really depends on their internal goals really.
 Speaker 2
How much money do you want to make?
 Speaker 2
The least amount of reserve bikes they have, the more money they will make, so it really does depend on what line they are walking themselves, but I think it could be very reliable.
 Speaker 2
But I think it's.
 Speaker 2


 Speaker 1
Just a blank potential.
 Speaker 3
Maybe?
 Speaker 3
You kind of already touched upon the lifestyle.
 Speaker 3
That's what Pete stands for and or like?
 Speaker 3
What about your lifestyle now?
 Speaker 3
You maybe after?
 Speaker 3
Change it so generally we have a.
 Speaker 3
It's about compatibility and if you if you shift away from focus on you but maybe focus on other people who you swap feeds we will like.
 Speaker 3
So do you have any ideas what kind of lifestyle swap feeds would stand for?
 Speaker 3
Or Germany Association?
 Speaker 3
With that, so like what kind of people were kind of like.
 Speaker 2
Hilti.
 Speaker 3
Sorry, sorry.
 Speaker 2
Mobiliti
 Speaker 3
Ability.
 Speaker 2
And not high probability because it's you you are constrained to one mode of transport.
 Speaker 2
But it's it's just a way to ensure you will always be mobile.
 Speaker 2
You all are almost always be ready to go wherever you need to go, and I think that will appeal to a lot of people.


Oh
 Speaker 2
You are going to be spending a lot of time.
 Speaker 2
Is studying, working socializing and will not necessarily be living at the same place like students who probably change student houses every few years.
 Speaker 3
Yeah.
 Speaker 2
Or change cities as well if that's what fits.
 Speaker 2
You don't need to take your back to probably give you one in the other city.
 Speaker 2
So yeah, the people who just.
 Speaker 2
Has a lot of uncertainty an where it'll be located and how their schedule look and who needs to be on the road a lot and would like being on the road with a bike.
 Speaker 3
I do differ from them, so these these students are young professionals that are always on the go, almost always on the tension.
 Speaker 3
Going from A to B.
 Speaker 2
No, not much.
 Speaker 2
Especially in the last 7-8 years, that was basically what I was doing, but like I ask for things are changing, but now I'm becoming more of what we call a.
 Speaker 3
Uh huh.
 Speaker 3
Yeah.
 Speaker 2
Good color match.
 Speaker 3
So like citizen is stuff alright, thanks.
 Speaker 2
Yeah, I I think quiet stream place.
 Speaker 2
We have a dog now so.
 Speaker 3
Yeah, moving in with the girlfriend.
 Speaker 2
Exactly.
 Speaker 2


 Speaker 2
Exactly, yeah, I guess.
 Speaker 3
So do you have any given the other stereotypes associated with swap feeds?
 Speaker 3
Creepy for the users.
 Speaker 2
At the biggest search up would be first year students.
 Speaker 3
First year students, particularly I think.
 Speaker 2
Yeah, especially first year students who took part in the citywide introduction.
 Speaker 3
Yeah.
 Speaker 3


 Speaker 2
Yeah, the introduction type.
 Speaker 2
And I would also then after that, people who are part of a students at society.
 Speaker 2
I don't know.
 Speaker 2
It's what we just Association.
 Speaker 3
Have anything?
 Speaker 2
Yeah?
 Speaker 2
So those students without anything so really not.


Yeah.
 Speaker 2
It's not very specific study there just for a group of students and you have like.
 Speaker 1
Yeah, yeah.
 Speaker 2
Really different kind of people.
 Speaker 2
Ann
 Speaker 2
I I would assume they would have swap pieces because they come up with these people who.
 Speaker 2
Really don't give a **** about.
 Speaker 2
Either money and people outside of their bubble.
 Speaker 2
Yes.
 Speaker 2


 Speaker 2
So I stopped with him perfectly just and I'm gonna go drink and is going to throw my bike against this three over here.
 Speaker 2
And if it's not here when I get back I'll walk home and I'll get a new one tomorrow.
 Speaker 3
Is that the group of users you like that you also imagine?
 Speaker 3
So, not only those people that are like active and going from A to B and moving along and don't have a fixed life, but also probably just really careless.
 Speaker 2
Or careless.
 Speaker 3
Yeah.
 Speaker 3


 Speaker 2
Yeah, I can imagine that.
 Speaker 3
But OK.
 Speaker 1
And how do you differ from them?
 Speaker 2
I am the last group I described.
 Speaker 1
Yeah, yeah.
 Speaker 1
Yeah.
 Speaker 2
Yeah, I'm I'm a bit of the polar opposite.
 Speaker 2
I care too much that everyone about Maine about sustainability and.
 Speaker 3
I see.
 Speaker 2
Yeah, so the really different side of it.
 Speaker 2
Like like I said before, I do care about convenience, but it shouldn't go at the cost of others.
 Speaker 2
Or the ecology around me?
 Speaker 1
Alright, thank you.
 Speaker 1
Yeah Lucas, I think we covered all of our questions.
 Speaker 3
Maybe maybe cases, and as an as an idea of how much it's what feeds costs per month box, yeah?
 Speaker 2
This country.
 Speaker 2
Like 15 euros, like a little bit more than a Netflix subscription.
 Speaker 3
50 or 15.
 Speaker 2
Fifteen 1/5.
 Speaker 2


 Speaker 2
1/5
 Speaker 3
OK, yeah.
 Speaker 1
All right?
 Speaker 2
Yep, secondhand bike year and cost.
 Speaker 2
And cost.
 Speaker 2


 Speaker 1
OK so it's compareable.
 Speaker 2
To buying a secondhand bike every year, yeah.
 Speaker 1
One secondhand bike.
 Speaker 1
Every year, all right.
 Speaker 2
I mean, if I sent this question to what I think it would cost to maintain a bike.
 Speaker 1
Uh huh.
 Speaker 2
I'd say between 50 and €100 a year, depending on your luck.
 Speaker 1
OK.
 Speaker 3
I think now we have everything, yeah?
 Speaker 1
Yeah, in case is there anything that you would still like to add which we did not discuss?
 Speaker 2
Yeah no I think I yeah I spoke.
 Speaker 2
All I need is to speak.
 Speaker 3
Yeah, and thank you for that.
 Speaker 2
All right then.
 Speaker 1
Very well, thank you for your time case and your answers and insights.
 Speaker 1
Can we could we contact you if we maybe need clarification on any answers?
 Speaker 2
Not sure.


Sure.
 Speaker 1
Alright, good to know and on that remark.
 Speaker 1
Thank you for your time.
 Speaker 1
Have a nice day I I will see you in person in a minute, but that's something else and yeah and not there right now so.
 Speaker 2
No.
 Speaker 2
Yes.
 Speaker 1
Yeah, and you can.
 Speaker 1
Yeah you can leave the call.
 Speaker 2
Yeah, thank you man.
 Speaker 2
It was nice seeing you look us.
 Speaker 3
Alright, pleasure to meet you or hear you brother, but good luck with your dinner.
 Speaker 2
Good what your quantitative study.
 Speaker 2
Thank you Sir.
 Speaker 2
Very nice bye bye.


Yeah.
 Speaker 3
Uh, I'm just taking out all the axes here.
 Speaker 1
All right, yeah, to sum it up there, it's it doesn't apply like cases cases case doesn't apply specifically to these seven things.
 Speaker 3
Thank you.
 Speaker 1
And so it it's.
 Speaker 1
But I think from his answers we can gather that he does not use swap seats because they do not have the bike for him.
 Speaker 1
Because in case you asked how tall he is, he is freakishly tall.
 Speaker 1
Uh huh.
 Speaker 1


 Speaker 1
Oh yeah, he's he's.
 Speaker 1
He's a giant an he's is over 6 foot man and he's very big guy as well and he has.
 Speaker 3
Cheese
 Speaker 1
Yes, Alers down loss which is a little bit of a handicap which effects his scracthing is there?
 Speaker 1
There's a word for that.
 Speaker 1
Give me a second cockbain cartilage.
 Speaker 3
OK.
 Speaker 1
Oh OK, yeah.
 Speaker 1
Yeah, and as such he very much he pays a lot of attention to making him himself physically comfortable and physically able to use things for a longer amount of time.
 Speaker 1
So a bike which will not bike.
 Speaker 3
Uh huh.
 Speaker 1
Like 100% OK and I'm I'm a bit filling in but I I've known this guy for eight years. A bike that would not be 100% OK for his legs would be an absolute no like that would be the last thing that he does and if I I would even go as far to say that if you if you had a swap free subscription.
 Speaker 3
Yeah.
 Speaker 3
Right?


Yes.
 Speaker 1
And he said, OK, I am a big guy.
 Speaker 1
Can you get me back and they said yeah sure we'll get you a proper bike and they get one and it's not good.
 Speaker 1
He will move hell on Earth.
 Speaker 1
Uh huh.
 Speaker 1


 Speaker 3
Even murder, yeah.
 Speaker 1
He would murder people and just be on the on the customer service for hours upon hours just waiting to be angry at someone for this.
 Speaker 3
Jeez.
 Speaker 1
Yeah, but but but that that is one part of the answer and I think another part is that he.
 Speaker 3
Right?
 Speaker 1
A man.
 Speaker 1
And that's something that I felt in Lisana an mine as well.
 Speaker 1
And maybe it's because we ask a question about stereo types, but their answers all resonate the same thing.
 Speaker 1
There's still, I have a stereo type of swap feed users and I see myself as not part of that group, and sometimes even the polar opposite.
 Speaker 1
And case started like listing negative aspects of the event.


Nothing.
 Speaker 3
And you're not stereotypes.
 Speaker 3
Has maybe been the wrong word.
 Speaker 1
Yeah, it may have been.
 Speaker 3
There is that.
 Speaker 1
It may have been.
 Speaker 1
It's yeah, yeah, definitely.
 Speaker 1
'cause this was the last interview so and we'll also have to research the other.
 Speaker 1
A couple of interviews.
 Speaker 1
But I feel like that that is a legitimate reason, though, that people have a certain image about not the brand, but about the users of the brand.
 Speaker 3
Yeah.
 Speaker 1
So I would classify we could classify that under image Barry.
 Speaker 3
Yes and then.
 Speaker 1
There's an that image of these users is just not compatible with their image.
 Speaker 3
2nd order image.
 Speaker 3
2nd order.
 Speaker 1
Yeah, with their image of themselves and as such they retained to their old habits and come up with a multitude of reasons.
 Speaker 3
Huh?
 Speaker 1
A lot of them involving economics.
 Speaker 1
Or compatibility with your own lifestyle.
 Speaker 1
Oh, or some other things, and even though I think all of those are legitimate reasons and this is a little bit speculative and very hard to test, especially without further research.
 Speaker 3
Yeah yeah, yeah.
 Speaker 1
But it might even be the core cause that because swap fees grew so much under the first years that everyone who is not a first year.
 Speaker 3
Yeah.
 Speaker 1
Like looked at them, it was like.
 Speaker 3
Please let me know.
 Speaker 1
These people are really treating their bikes like **** I'm going to not do that.
 Speaker 3
I'm gonna head out.
 Speaker 3
Yeah and yeah indeed.
 Speaker 3


 Speaker 3
And yeah, indeed.
 Speaker 1
Yeah, because it swapped feeds really grew rapidly under first years because they did a very smart marketing trick and then I feel like it just capped.


Uh huh.
 Speaker 1
Because their growth was just a one group like Bam.
 Speaker 1
OK, all these people do not know the service.
 Speaker 1
Do not know the customs of the city yet.
 Speaker 1
Let's give them our product and it was genius.
 Speaker 1
But all the people that have lived in the city saw this happen and they were like.
 Speaker 3
Yeah, yeah.
 Speaker 1
I mean.
 Speaker 1
I could I could not.
 Speaker 3
Yeah.
 Speaker 3
Pretty much the same happened when I was in Denmark, where I did a summer school multiple one anyway, so we that we were given a swap feeds from the University.
 Speaker 3
And then basically people in the was really tiny town started complaining about these these students with their swap feeds blocking the roads and yadda yadda yadda.
 Speaker 3
So I think there's actually this actually has a.
 Speaker 3
Definitely have that as a as a grounding, or like if there is definitely a reasoning.
 Speaker 1
Yeah.
 Speaker 1
Yeah, if it's the core reason or like how important it is, I don't know, but there is definitely an impact a measurable impact, certain qualities of the first big adopter group of swap feeds.
 Speaker 3
I was picking up.
 Speaker 3
No.
 Speaker 3
Yeah, yeah.
 Speaker 1
And how people then react to that?
 Speaker 3
Normative isn't it? Yeah yeah.
 Speaker 1
Interesting, and I've also heard the.
 Speaker 3
That's for sure.
 Speaker 1
I've also heard the argument.
 Speaker 1
I already had a bike a lot of times.
 Speaker 3
A lot of times I mean, you already have a bite.
 Speaker 1
A lot of time.
 Speaker 1


 Speaker 1
Time.
 Speaker 3
Handsome, but like.
 Speaker 1
It's like why don't you have a swap feats?
 Speaker 1
Because I already have a bike.
 Speaker 3
Oh, OK, but this is like this is the question.
 Speaker 1
And that way, yeah.
 Speaker 3
This is what the question is.
 Speaker 3
If we're back with breakdown, would you consider getting this Whole Foods so fast was really like?
 Speaker 1
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So it's.
 Speaker 3
Yeah, definitely.
 Speaker 3
I think it's a great thing.
 Speaker 3
To dot dot dot.
 Speaker 1
Yeah.
 Speaker 1


 Speaker 3
So yeah.
 Speaker 1
It's it's it's.
 Speaker 3
For example, Oscar was like I, I just don't.
 Speaker 3
I just don't like the attitude of not fixing your bike yourself.
 Speaker 1
And then all of a sudden it's about attitudes and values and stuff.
 Speaker 1
And that's that's really that the yeah, the first adopter group.


Right?
 Speaker 3
Yeah.
 Speaker 3
Chapter one.
 Speaker 1
Very interesting.


Phil.
 Speaker 3
In it.
 Speaker 1
Very interesting alright.
 Speaker 1
Case was also cooking my dinner so I am going to hang up if that's all the same to you.
 Speaker 3
Go for that.
 Speaker 3
Of course I'm going to go for Frisbee.
 Speaker 1
Oh yeah.
